T&#8217;was love at first sight when the two French producers, Brodinski and Gesaffelstein, joined hand in hand to create, collab, and tour the world as Bromance. Brodinski has been a household name since 2007, while Gesaffelstein has emerged as one of our favorite techno heavy weights of 2011. 2011 was a golden year for the two. Brodinski teamed up with Gesafelstein to form Bromance Records and release their first EP, Bromance #1. Many of us who have heard Brodinski&#8217;s essential mix may be skeptical of his productions, but his song<em> Let the Beat Control Your Body </em>(Bromance #1 EP)\\\\xC2\\\\xA0has lived up to its name. Gesaffelstein&#8217;s set at HARD summer in LA was pure techno bliss and his song <em>Control Movement </em>(Bromance #1 EP) is incredible. I can&#8217;t wait to hear these two on Mezzanine&#8217;s Funktion Ones!

Additionally, the promoter of EDC, Insomniac, demonstrated that it operates a well-organized, safe and secure event. The people at Insomniac are proven professionals, and we&#8217;re excited to work together to create an unforgettable EDC in 2012 here at LVMS.&#8221;</p>\\n    <p>Electric Daisy Carnival Las Vegas was internationally recognized in September at the 2011 DJ Awards in Ibiza as the International Festival of the Year.</p>\\n    <p>Pretty exciting to watch EDC evolve to what it has today. Watching the electronic scene grow from underground warehouse raves to earth shattering 230,000 person events has been quite a trip. It appears to be heading for the stars with no sign of stopping.

A weekly dose of your favourite\\\\xC2\\\\xA0<em>house, progressive house, electro house,\\\\xC2\\\\xA0</em>and<em>\\\\xC2\\\\xA0everything-in-between</em>.. Each week I'll bring you a selection of my favourites of the week from the best producers in the world. I'll try to feature an emerging artist or two that catches my eye more than most, so make sure to keep your eye out for weekly servings of the biggest and best names in house music worldwide.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>First things first, I'd just like to say a few words about some award ceremony I kept hearing about last weekend. While it's clear that EDM is here to stay, its the incredible voice of a woman that has had more of an impact on popular music than any.\\\\xC2\\\\xA0<strong>Adele </strong>took home six Grammys, rightfully so, and to honour her, I've started off this weeks mix with a vocal heavy rendition of \\\\\"Rolling In The Deep\\\\\" from <strong>Marcus Maison &amp; Will Dragen</strong>, two of my favourites on The Club (Actually have a bootleg mashup of theirs featured on todays post).\\\\xC2\\\\xA0Next week I'll make part 2 of this particular mix series featuring my favourite <em>electro house</em> tracks from the past few weeks, if that's what you prefer. For now, enjoy the beautiful vocals and epic melodies of 30 of the best of 2012 so far.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><div class=\\\\\"player-links\\\\\">\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"track-single page-feed\\\\\">\\\\n                  <a href=\\\\\"http://soundcloud.com/midknightmusic/the-club-best-of-weeks-20-21\\\\\" target=\\\\\"_blank\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link soundcloud\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Soundcloud\\\\\">\\\\n        SC<span></span>\\\\n      </a>\\\\n                <a href=\\\\\"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/37007206/download?consumer_key=05c76df9f7dc61bd4981517dc069adee\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link soundcloud-download\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Soundcloud Download\\\\\">\\\\n      Download<span></span>\\\\n    </a>\\\\n        <a href=\\\\\"#play\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link play track\\\\\" id=\\\\\"link76573-29\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Play\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('76573-29');return false;\\\\\">\\\\n      Play<span></span>\\\\n    </a>\\\\n    <span class=\\\\\"player-link-title\\\\\" id=\\\\\"title76573-29\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('76573-29');return false;\\\\\"><span class=\\\\\"artist\\\\\">THE CLUB best of weeks 20, 21, & 22</span> <span class=\\\\\"time\\\\\">(01:17:52)</span></span>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"clear\\\\\"></div>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </div></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>Lets start this week off with a look at a few young Swedes that I've been paying close attention to for a couple of months.\\\\xC2\\\\xA0<strong>Bjornberg </strong>released the follow up to his club anthem of 2011 \\\\\"Absolut\\\\\" this week, and while it maintains the uplifting energy that his breakthrough banger had, this one, called \\\\\"Libella\\\\\", goes just a bit heavier. Its clear that the 17 year old is only improving as a producer and I'm more excited to see the future of this kid that anyone else in music right now. Another new project out of Sweden called <strong>Qulinez</strong>, the production duo consisting of Alexander Lager and Johannes Gustafsson, has just hit the ground running with their release of \\\\\"Troll\\\\\". The club ready bomb has massive support already, and since being picked up by <strong>Steve Angello</strong>'s Size Records, it has already received airtime on Pete Tong's Essential Mix and been released as part of <strong>Hardwell</strong>'s\\\\xC2\\\\xA0bootleg pack where the Dutch heavyweight mashed up \\\\\"Troll\\\\\" with \\\\\"Antidote\\\\\" and <strong>SHM</strong>'s remix of \\\\\"Paradise\\\\\". \\\\xC2\\\\xA0</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><div class=\\\\\"player-links\\\\\">\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"track-single page-feed\\\\\">\\\\n          <a href=\\\\\"http://files2.earmilk.com/tracks/MjAxMi0wMi9MaWJlbGxhIChPcmlnaW5hbCBNaXgpLm1wMw==.mp3\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link download\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Download\\\\\">\\\\n        Download<span></span>\\\\n      </a>\\\\n                        <a href=\\\\\"#play\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link play track\\\\\" id=\\\\\"link76573-0\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Play\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('76573-0');return false;\\\\\">\\\\n      Play<span></span>\\\\n    </a>\\\\n    <span class=\\\\\"player-link-title\\\\\" id=\\\\\"title76573-0\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('76573-0');return false;\\\\\"><span class=\\\\\"artist\\\\\">Bjornberg</span> - Libella (Original Mix) <span class='time'>(06:07)</span></span>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"clear\\\\\"></div>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </div><div>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><div class=\\\\\"player-links\\\\\">\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"track-single page-feed\\\\\">\\\\n          <a href=\\\\\"http://files2.earmilk.com/tracks/MjAxMi0wMi9Ucm9sbCAoT3JpZ2luYWwgTWl4KS5tcDM=.mp3\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link download\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Download\\\\\">\\\\n        Download<span></span>\\\\n      </a>\\\\n                        <a href=\\\\\"#play\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link play track\\\\\" id=\\\\\"link76573-1\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Play\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('76573-1');return false;\\\\\">\\\\n      Play<span></span>\\\\n    </a>\\\\n    <span class=\\\\\"player-link-title\\\\\" id=\\\\\"title76573-1\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('76573-1');return false;\\\\\"><span class=\\\\\"artist\\\\\">Qulinez</span> - Troll (Original Mix) <span class='time'>(05:07)</span></span>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"clear\\\\\"></div>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </div><div>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><div class=\\\\\"player-links\\\\\">\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"track-single page-feed\\\\\">\\\\n              <a href=\\\\\"#stream\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link stream\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Stream\\\\\">\\\\n        Stream<span></span>\\\\n      </a>\\\\n                    <a href=\\\\\"#play\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link play track\\\\\" id=\\\\\"link76573-2\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Play\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('76573-2');return false;\\\\\">\\\\n      Play<span></span>\\\\n    </a>\\\\n    <span class=\\\\\"player-link-title\\\\\" id=\\\\\"title76573-2\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('76573-2');return false;\\\\\"><span class=\\\\\"artist\\\\\">Hard Rock Sofa</span> - Quasar (Original Mix) <span class='time'>(06:26)</span></span>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"clear\\\\\"></div>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </div><div>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><div class=\\\\\"player-links\\\\\">\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"track-single page-feed\\\\\">\\\\n          <a href=\\\\\"http://files2.earmilk.com/tracks/MjAxMi0wMi9XYXRjaCBNZSBOb3cgKE9yaWdpbmFsIE1peCkubXAz.mp3\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link download\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Download\\\\\">\\\\n        Download<span></span>\\\\n      </a>\\\\n                        <a href=\\\\\"#play\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link play track\\\\\" id=\\\\\"link76573-3\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Play\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('76573-3');return false;\\\\\">\\\\n      Play<span></span>\\\\n    </a>\\\\n    <span class=\\\\\"player-link-title\\\\\" id=\\\\\"title76573-3\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('76573-3');return false;\\\\\"><span class=\\\\\"artist\\\\\">Dani L.

Its clear that age doesn't matter when it comes to dropping club ready bombs, as most of what I feature here on the club comes from the under-25 age group. Jerry, at just 22, is certainly poised to make a run for dominance, whether its his electro infused progressive house bangers or his beautiful bootlegs of tracks like\\\\xC2\\\\xA0<strong>M83</strong>'s \\\\\"Midnight City\\\\\", he has managed to develop his skills into an all around\\\\xC2\\\\xA0production\\\\xC2\\\\xA0wizard. Just comparing the two tracks here today you can get a feel for how versatile this kid is.

There he started watching Electric Circus on TV and started to listen to the radio which allowed him to fall in love with electronic music. In 2005, Minhaj and a friend picked up Cubase and completed their first track together under the moniker, \\\\\"Nightscape\\\\\". Together , they found that their biggest influences always were drawn from late 90s era. After a time, the two went their separate ways and Minhaj later started his new project, Blue Neptune. He released his first EP under the ambient digital label, Silk Sofa and since then, has been incorporating his ambient style into house and techno music.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </blockquote>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><div class=\\\\\"player-links\\\\\">\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"track-single page-feed\\\\\">\\\\n          <a href=\\\\\"http://files2.earmilk.com/tracks/MjAxMi0wMS8xMSBCcmVhdGhlLm1wMw==.mp3\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link download\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Download\\\\\">\\\\n        Download<span></span>\\\\n      </a>\\\\n                        <a href=\\\\\"#play\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link play track\\\\\" id=\\\\\"link75657-2\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Play\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('75657-2');return false;\\\\\">\\\\n      Play<span></span>\\\\n    </a>\\\\n    <span class=\\\\\"player-link-title\\\\\" id=\\\\\"title75657-2\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('75657-2');return false;\\\\\"><span class=\\\\\"artist\\\\\">Blue Neptune</span> - Breathe <span class='time'>(06:18)</span></span>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"clear\\\\\"></div>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </div><p><div class=\\\\\"player-links\\\\\">\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"track-single page-feed\\\\\">\\\\n                  <a href=\\\\\"http://soundcloud.com/blueneptune/m83-dont-save-us-from-the\\\\\" target=\\\\\"_blank\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link soundcloud\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Soundcloud\\\\\">\\\\n        SC<span></span>\\\\n      </a>\\\\n                <a href=\\\\\"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/34453625/download?consumer_key=05c76df9f7dc61bd4981517dc069adee\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link soundcloud-download\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Soundcloud Download\\\\\">\\\\n      Download<span></span>\\\\n    </a>\\\\n        <a href=\\\\\"#play\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link play track\\\\\" id=\\\\\"link75657-5\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Play\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('75657-5');return false;\\\\\">\\\\n      Play<span></span>\\\\n    </a>\\\\n    <span class=\\\\\"player-link-title\\\\\" id=\\\\\"title75657-5\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('75657-5');return false;\\\\\"><span class=\\\\\"artist\\\\\">M83</span> - Don't Save Us From the Flames (Blue Neptune Bootleg) <span class=\\\\\"time\\\\\">(09:19)</span></span>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"clear\\\\\"></div>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </div></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <ul>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <li><a href=\\\\\"http://www.facebook.com/blueneptune\\\\\">facebook.com/blueneptune</a></li>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <li><a href=\\\\\"http://soundcloud.com/blueneptune\\\\\">soundcloud.com/blueneptune</a></li>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </ul>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <hr />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>For the full EP streaming checkout the original post:\\\\xC2\\\\xA0<strong><a href=\\\\\"http://www.earmilk.com/2012/01/21/earmilk-presents-only-at-night-vol-1/\\\\\">Earmilk Presents: Only At Night - Vol. 1</a></strong></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>or go straight to the LP and:</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h3><a href=\\\\\"http://files2.earmilk.com/upload/releases/Only At Night - Vol. 1.zip\\\\\">Download - Only At Night - Vol. 1\\\\xC2\\\\xA0</a></h3>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <ul>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <li><a href=\\\\\"https://www.facebook.com/onlyatnighttoronto\\\\\">Facebook.com/OnlyAtNightToronto</a></li>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </ul><img src=\\\\\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/earmilk/~4/jCk5zwgKm7U\\\\\" height=\\\\\"1\\\\\" width=\\\\\"1\\\\\"/>\"\\n  entry_id: http://www.earmilk.com/2012/02/18/only-at-night-lp-volume-1-the-features/\\n  published: 2012-02-19 03:27:08 Z\\n  summary: \" A couple of weeks ago, we announced the release of Only At Night - Vol. 1, the frist volume of what is planned to be an ongoing series.

The spotlight is a double edged sword, and those who are placed within are often both rewarded by it's benefits and thwarted by it's scrutiny. Struggling for the center stage is in many ways unsettling, as band after band rises up to test their name against the judgement of society often to only be cast away among the masses. Every year there are a handful of artists that manage to tread faster than others, emerging from the darkness of the underground and bursting forth into the light of recognition. It is these chosen few that we as music fanatics obsess with,\\\\xC2\\\\xA0marveling at their rise to fame and salivating over their good fortune. Yet as we scramble to jump aboard the bandwagon, we often overlook the next big thing only to find it in hindsight. What is vogue right now might not be what's optimum, and it takes a disciplined ear to discount the decoys and find the true babe in the woods.\\\\xC2\\\\xA0</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><strong>EARMILK </strong>takes pride in our history of staying on the cutting edge with new artists, and along with our new specs we're moving in a bigger, better direction with our articles as well. Our objective is to continue bringing the best new music around while providing a more\\\\xC2\\\\xA0in-depth look at the content, producing honest editorials that stray away from the daily gossip and expose each artist in a genuine, personal manner. Our focus today lies on <strong>Oliver Tank</strong>, an Australian native with a particular knack at turning off the adrenaline and delivering excitement through ambience.\\\\xC2\\\\xA0</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>When initially hearing Oliver Tank's music it's easy to picture him as a suave, posh gentleman who spends his days strolling the beaches of Sydney in a white tuxedo, flocks of ladies fighting to stand in his shadow. On the contrary, what you'll discover is a young college student who divides his time partying, hanging with mates and making records in his bedroom. His lifestyle is unbelievably laid back, and both his lackadaisical attitude and style of living are paralleled in his music.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>While the first major musicians he was exposed to were <strong>Simon &amp; Garfunkel</strong> and <strong>Michael Jackson</strong>, if you asked him what he listens to now he'd read off a list comprised mostly of Mainstream Hip-Hop and an eclectic array of beat-driven club tunes -- a stark contrast to the music he produces. His music, as he calls it, is comprised of <em>\\\\\"fairly accessible tracks in terms of listening to them, but disguised with more unusual instrumentation.\\\\\"</em> His ultimate goal is to make something original, yet not so far off that people can't relate to it while also maintaining a personal interest in the product. His EP <em>Dreams</em> garners an almost overwhelming sense of introspective seclusion, achieving Oliver's goal of originality while striking to the core of each listener's either subconscious or as in most cases -- uncomfortably vivid emotions.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>Oliver grew up on a diet of tapes his parents had collected, and the first record he purchased was <em>Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavoured Water</em> by <strong>Limp Biscuit</strong>. It's odd, considering his early musical influences, how strikingly different his music is to anything he listened to as a child. <em>Dreams</em> sounds like a side project concocted from the minds of <strong>James Blake</strong> and <strong>Jose Gonzalez</strong>. There is a feeling of calm that loiters in the shadows of the album, meandering in and out of each track with a subtle ambivalence. Built around chimerical harmonies, gentle beats and a shockingly refreshing use of auto tune, the EP manages to shout complexity while delivering itself with a marvelous simplicity.\\\\xC2\\\\xA0The Debut EP\\\\xC2\\\\xA0was featured as our <a href=\\\\\"http://www.earmilk.com/2011/12/29/earmilk-top-20-indie-albums-of-2011-10-1/\\\\\"><strong>Number 1 Indie album of 2011</strong></a>, and Oliver has a set of works that he plans on releasing throughout the year, beginning with an exclusive premiere of the single \\\\\"Help You Breath\\\\\" that he's releasing through <strong>EARMILK</strong> today.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><div class=\\\\\"player-links\\\\\">\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"track-single page-feed\\\\\">\\\\n          <a href=\\\\\"http://files2.earmilk.com/tracks/MjAxMi0wMi9IZWxwIFlvdSBCcmVhdGhlLm1wMw==.mp3\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link download\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Download\\\\\">\\\\n        Download<span></span>\\\\n      </a>\\\\n                        <a href=\\\\\"#play\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link play track\\\\\" id=\\\\\"link75481-0\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Play\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('75481-0');return false;\\\\\">\\\\n      Play<span></span>\\\\n    </a>\\\\n    <span class=\\\\\"player-link-title\\\\\" id=\\\\\"title75481-0\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('75481-0');return false;\\\\\"><span class=\\\\\"artist\\\\\">Oliver Tank</span> - Help You Breathe <span class='time'>(03:45)</span></span>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"clear\\\\\"></div>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </div><p>Oliver described \\\\\"Help You Breath\\\\\" as <em>\\\\\"One of the best tracks I've ever done.\\\\\"</em> The premise behind the track is relatively facile, as it is quite simply about breathing. But if you move past the literal take and focus on the track as a physical work, you begin to appreciate it's beauty. While \\\\\"Help You Breath\\\\\" may sound similar to everything off of Dreams, the trained ear will notice a grand improvement in production and layering. The bass and instrumentation are better controlled than before, which ends up bolstering Oliver's voice -- an improvement that is exhibited brilliantly in the opening minute of the song. Oliver has plans for two albums this year, one being a cover album of an array of Hip-Hop tracks, and the other a new EP that will be released later this year.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <hr />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p ><strong>EARMILK INTERVIEW: OLIVER TANK</strong></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p ><img title=\\\\\"OT\\\\\" src=\\\\\"http://i.imgur.com/Zsfx2.jpg\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"OT\\\\\" width=\\\\\"640\\\\\" height=\\\\\"214\\\\\" /></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <blockquote>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p ><em><strong>\\\\\"There's a fine line between originality and accessibility.

About five minutes before the interview, I realized that despite Oliver being one of the least famous artists I've had a chance to interview -- \\\\xC2\\\\xA0for some reason I was incredibly anxious. I couldn't quite put my finger on the reason, whether it was the lack of information I had been able to scrounge up on him or the fact that we had just ranked his EP as the top Indie album of the year -- but my frantic nerves needed sedation before I began, so I stepped outside for a cig. About halfway through I just said \\\\\"fuck it\\\\\" and hit the call button. What followed ended up being of the more laid back, fruitful discussions I've had in a long time.<span >\\\\xC2\\\\xA0</span></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM:</strong> Who's that -- who's that dude in the background?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT:</strong> That's my friend Dave. We were just drinking last night night so he stayed over.\\\\xC2\\\\xA0</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><em>I laughed. Before the interview I was expecting some suave, posh musical snob to appear on my monitor, but instead Oliver looked like he had just rolled out of bed, hair a mess and a hungover friend half asleep in recovery mode resting against the wall in the background. I knew exactly what they were feeling. I'd been there, done that - and it made me comfortable to see this. My nerves eased up a bit but it was freezing outside, so I sat in front of the vent from my dryer, let the heat warm me up for a second and jumped into the interview full throttle.</em></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>As you can see, it's winter here. You guys are in summer right now correct?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT: </strong>Yeah but it's been a pretty shit summer <em>(laughs)</em>. I dunno, it's been raining throughout the whole of December -- it's pretty nice at the moment -- pretty hot today, but yeah.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM:</strong> So there's really not a whole lot of information on you out there at the moment. To kick things off, give a brief round up of your musical history, where you started and the journey that's gotten you to the here and now.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT: </strong>I think the first instrument I played was the trombone in the primary school band. Which was sort of interesting, but I never really got much into that. Then as I got into high school I began playing guitar, and played in a lot of rock bands I guess. Then after high school finished I wasn't enjoying guitar as much as I used to -- I wanted to do more acoustic stuff you know? But then I got into Uni and started learning to use production software, like Ableton, Protools etc. and started learning how to use that. At that time, I was just recording my own acoustic music, but I started to really take an interest in Electronic music -- A friend of mine really got me into it and I dunno, there were just a lot of things happening in that genre that I'd never really heard before. So I decided to have a crack at it at the start of last year and, yeah. I guess it went really well. I sort of found my style of production then, and have discovered a type of music that I really enjoyed making and has a lot of potential to be original. So last year I really just started making music. I did a Snoop Dog cover that got played on the radio around here, and from there I released \\\\\"Last Night I Heard Everything In Slow Motion\\\\\" and from there it got played more on the radio, and people started blogging about it and everything sort of happened at once. At the start of last year nothing was really happening for me, and now heaps of stuff is happening which is awesome.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>Well absolutely, and speaking about the industry and the Electronic aspect, the industry right now -- particularly over here in the states and our top 40 charts -- It's cluttered with a bunch of musicians trying to desperately hop on this Electronic bus, if you will. While your music is definitely more electronic, it falls more along the lines of Apparat or Porcelain Raft rather than Avicii per say, where it has more of a downtempo-esk chillwave feel. This laid back style your music has -- where does the inspiration for that draw from, and why did you choose to go that path rather than something more club-esk when you started making your most recent music?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT: </strong>Yeah, um -- I don't know -- I don't really listen to that much chilled out music myself, I listen to a lot of Hip-Hop and a lot of harder Electronic music. Dave over here (<em>motioning to his now conscious friend behind him)</em>\\\\xC2\\\\xA0gets me into a lot of Hip-Hop as well <em>(laughs)</em>. But yeah I dunno, it sort of like a bit of escapism I guess, sort of just something I do that's pretty personal because it's just me working on music. What you're getting from it is just everything I've been working on. And I think a lot of people associate Electronic music -- when they hear that term they think it's gonna be club bangers and stuff like that, but it has the potential to be chilled out as well which is something I think people only recently started to realize. The way I write music is to make fairly accessible tracks in terms of listening to them, but disguised with more unusual instrumentation. I think that's the best songwriting for me -- Is something that people have never heard before but that they can really relate to. There's a fine line between originality and accessibility. The key is to get as close to that line as possible and not cross it. If you try to sound too original it can just sound weird and people won't to listen to it.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>Right, and as you said there's so much more to Electronic music than what people typically think of when referring to that genre. Unfortunately the vast majority of people only associate Electronic music with face melting club banger shit which is not really something you can listen to any place, any time, whereas your music can pretty much serve as a backdrop for any occasion. What was the turning point when you decided to go the route of music rather than something else as a career?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT:</strong> I dunno I was never really that good at anything else <em>(laughs)</em> so I was like you know, I may as well give this music thing a shot. But I think for a long time I was never really taking it that seriously, and then when I started to really enjoy the music I was making and I noticed that other people were as well - I suppose it was really a year ago when I started to find my feet in terms of what I was doing. I was always trying to do something original and I think I'm pretty close to doing that now. I'd say that's about then, but the most rewarding thing was that my friends and other people enjoyed it, and then people all around Australia were enjoying it and now all around the world. That's probably the most rewarding thing.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><img src=\\\\\"http://i.imgur.com/POtbE.jpg\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"Oliver tank Banner 2\\\\\" width=\\\\\"640\\\\\" height=\\\\\"213\\\\\" /></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>I'd imagine so. Now moving into your EP [Dreams] -- it sort of took me all over the place emotionally, which is a good thing because I enjoy albums that really strike at the core of my emotions. The majority of the songs seem to hint at a relationship or someone in your life. What's the story behind the entire thing and more particularly the lyrics and the romantic undertone, in a sense, with the EP?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT: </strong>I guess the whole thing is sort of about the idea of being consumed by something. It's not really about any specific experiences that I've had, just more about in general that feeling of when something weighs on you so heavy that you can't really so or think about anything else. It just sort of consumes your life? I always wanted to have intertextuality between the tracks, and that's why I mention lyrics from one song in other songs. I feel like if you appreciate it together a one body of work you get more out of it than if your just listen to individual tracks.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\">\\\\\"Last Night I Heard Everything In Slow Motion\\\\\" That track, the title is about when I was with a couple of mates and we were just getting really blazed and I was listening to Ratatat -- their 9 <em>Beats</em> disc -- and I was listening to \\\\\"One\\\\\" and I was just so ripped. I swear I could hear it in slow motion because I was that fucked up, so I wrote down in my phone <em>Hearing things in slow motion</em> but then I thought you know, I'm not going to know what this is about tomorrow, so then I wrote <em>Last night I heard everything in slow motion</em>. So from there I sort of felt like that was appropriate title for a track. I guess I smoke a little bit <em>(laughs)</em>.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><div class=\\\\\"player-links\\\\\">\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"track-single page-feed\\\\\">\\\\n          <a href=\\\\\"http://files2.earmilk.com/tracks/MjAxMi0wMi8wMyBMYXN0IE5pZ2h0IEkgSGVhcmQgRXZlcnl0aGluZyBpbiBTbG93IE1vdGlvbi5tcDM=.mp3\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link download\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Download\\\\\">\\\\n        Download<span></span>\\\\n      </a>\\\\n                        <a href=\\\\\"#play\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link play track\\\\\" id=\\\\\"link75481-1\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Play\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('75481-1');return false;\\\\\">\\\\n      Play<span></span>\\\\n    </a>\\\\n    <span class=\\\\\"player-link-title\\\\\" id=\\\\\"title75481-1\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('75481-1');return false;\\\\\"><span class=\\\\\"artist\\\\\">Oliver Tank</span> - Last Night I Heard Everything in Slow Motion <span class='time'>(03:44)</span></span>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"clear\\\\\"></div>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </div><h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\">With my tracks I'm not writing them from a really heavy personal experience, like my life is not that hard. Nothing really that bad has ever happened to me. It's more that I can appreciate those feelings even though I may not have experienced all of them myself. I think everybody can relate to that.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>Absolutely, and you know as you just mentioned, that track [\\\\\"Last Night I Heard Everything In Slow Motion\\\\\"] was inspired by the night of Ratatat and glorious herbal festivities, if you will <em>(laughs)</em>. Inspiration from substance is a practice that certainly isn't a stranger to musicians throughout history. As for yourself, is that a common occurrence -- not necessarily that you sit down and smoke to inspire yourself -- but in terms of your music, do you draw a lot of inspiration for songs while basking in the glorious world that weed can bring to the table?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT:</strong> I think I have a lot of good Ideas when I'm a bit ripped but I don't usually, I mean I'll write stuff down -- You know how you have all these good ideas?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong><em>(Laughing)</em> Yes, I definitely know what you're talking about.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT: </strong><em>(Laughs)</em> Yeah, I always try write them down in my phone or whatever, and the next day I'll look back at them and if anything's worth investigating further I'll approach it when I'm sober. I think I've written a few lyrics when I'm in that state of mind, but I think if you listen to my music when you're smoking I think it sounds a lot better. That's probably the main reason I do it the way I do, it's just really slow and chilled out and not intense, and I think you can really appreciate it in that state of mind.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <blockquote>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><em><strong>\\\\\"I'm going to do some Justin Timberlake tracks, N.E.R.D., 'Hey Ma' by Cam'ron, 'Let Me Blow Ya Mind' by Eve, etc. Yeah I dunno it might sound strange.\\\\\"</strong></em></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </blockquote>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>You mentioned that you record the vast majority of your music in your bedroom or at Uni. When you're doing that what equipment do you use when you're doing that. Is it just simply you and your computer or do you have a set of instruments you draw from as well?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><img class=\\\\\"  alignleft\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Oliver Tank Bedroom\\\\\" src=\\\\\"http://i.imgur.com/VBUla.jpg\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"OT 1\\\\\" width=\\\\\"300\\\\\" height=\\\\\"225\\\\\" /></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><em>Oliver proceeded to give me a walkthrough of his place. Contrary to polar belief, there aren't nasty critters all over Australia. His place looked a lot like my own -- slightly messy, organized chaos with half finished projects everywhere. On his bed were all of his instruments for his live shows, which were a small array of beat pads, analogue boards, midis and synthesizers. He showed me his Kaossilator (which I drooled over for a second), his Voice Live vocal processor and an SP404 which he ran all through a mixer. Certainly not a professional studio, but he's managed to make it work.</em></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-align: left;\\\\\"><strong >OT:</strong><span > Basically I run the Kaoss pad and the reverb pedal as sends in the mixer, so I can send any effect that the Kaoss pad does, or any reverb to either the drum pad, the 404, the vocals or the guitar. It's just a really convenient setup. In terms of actually recording, I had a friend that played violin who helped with \\\\\"Last Night I Heard Everything In Slow Motion,\\\\\" so I had to sync it up and side chain it, etc. A few tracks on the EP had guitar which was me. A lot of it is Midi and Synths and stuff like that that I've sourced from programs like Ableton. Everything else is really just samples that I've found online through creative commons websites.</span></h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-align: left;\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>Moving back to the Dreams, the flagship track \\\\\"Up All Night\\\\\" struck harder than any other track for me personally. In the lyrics it sort of expresses the despair of someone seemingly waiting for someone else to arrive, whether it's simply a date or a return home. As you mentioned before you said that your stuff sort of deals with things overwhelming one as a person but nothing really specific. It seems -- in the song -- that basically you are waiting from someone to arrive and then they teach you how to dance, real slow <em>(laughing)</em>. What's going on with that?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><div class=\\\\\"player-links\\\\\">\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"track-single page-feed\\\\\">\\\\n          <a href=\\\\\"http://files2.earmilk.com/tracks/MjAxMi0wMi8wMSBVcCBBbGwgTmlnaHQubXAz.mp3\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link download\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Download\\\\\">\\\\n        Download<span></span>\\\\n      </a>\\\\n                        <a href=\\\\\"#play\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link play track\\\\\" id=\\\\\"link75481-2\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Play\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('75481-2');return false;\\\\\">\\\\n      Play<span></span>\\\\n    </a>\\\\n    <span class=\\\\\"player-link-title\\\\\" id=\\\\\"title75481-2\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('75481-2');return false;\\\\\"><span class=\\\\\"artist\\\\\">Oliver Tank</span> - Up All Night <span class='time'>(03:10)</span></span>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"clear\\\\\"></div>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </div><h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT: </strong>\\\\\"Up All Night\\\\\" was one of the tracks I wrote last. I had finished most of the EP and then I decided to put an extra track on which ended up being \\\\\"Up All Night\\\\\" -- which I'm really glad I did because it's one of my favorite tracks as well. I wanted to port some unusual instrumentation that hasn't been really used in electronic music, with that sort of reverb based instrumental with the really sparse bass and echoing drum beat. I also wanted to tie in \\\\\"Last Night I Heard Everything In Slow Motion\\\\\" which is why the line <em>It'll be alright but I understand now</em> is also in that track. I just feel like it ties the work together, and it was one of the songs that was released before the EP, so it presented the album well with what people already knew. As far as the story, the up all night part was really because I don't ever go to bed really early, I go to bed usually around 4am and wake up midday. There's not much of a story to the song. People are so invested in my songs, and I sort of feel a bit bad <em>(Laughing)</em> that it's not about a really heavy personal experience or something. It's just me working on music, and I like the fact that there's sort of a mystery about it. I think the fact that it's not really about anything particular leaves it open to interpretation more than if it was.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>Well I don't think good music necessarily always has to have a story behind it and this is certainly a great example of that.

Anyway I got really drunk with her and we did a vocal studies class together and learned how to use our voice together. She's always down to help with a track and I sort of discovered whilst we were at Uni together that our voices compliment each other's well, so I started to use her for the EP. Not only because she has an amazing voice but also because I think she needs to be recognized. She's not cdoing much (musically) for herself and I'm happy to help her. I think in the future I'm going to produce some tracks for her to sing over in her own name. I think there's huge potential with her. So I just worked with her and it ended up working out so well -- her harmonies are, I dunno a better singer so it's always nice to have that on board.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>With the recording and production of the album, was that a solo ordeal that you did all yourself or did you work with someone with mastering it at the end?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT: </strong>I did most of it myself, at the end I got it mastered by this guy in Sydney, but I also helped out with the mastering a bit. Mastering isn't really my strong point. I think it's something that you have to really spend a lot of time doing if you want to get good at it. I only recently learned how to use production software, I think about a year and a half ago really. I'm much better at it now than I was before but like I said it's not really my strong point.

It's not going to be too much similar to what I've been doing at the moment, but you'll\\\\xC2\\\\xA0 definitely be able to tell that it's Oliver Tank.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>So in these Hip-Hop covers that are coming up, do you plan on rapping in any of them?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT:</strong> Oh no, no (laughs). Basically, with the Snoop Dogg one I slowed it down, took a few nice little lines from the song and then sampled part of the song and played some distorted guitar underneath. It's probably one of my favorite tracks that I've done, I really enjoy it.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>Moving away from the music and to you personally, what do you enjoy doing on your down time?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT:</strong> Oh man, my whole life is down time <em>(laughs)</em>. I don't work at the moment, but I haven't really worked in a long time. I worked a lot in high school so I saved up a bit of money that I've been living off for a while. I dunno though, my downtime I really just hang with my mates. During the day I just make music or sometimes at night. Play basketball with my friends, smoke, drink, go to the beach -- my live's pretty crazy <em>(laughing)</em>, I dunno.\\\\xC2\\\\xA0I actually love my life. It's my ideal [life] -- Just making music and getting to hang out with mates and stuff. The fact that people actually enjoy my music and that I'm sewn to get all of these great opportunities with it is just like, a dream come true.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM:</strong> I can imagine, I'm a bit envious of you right now. You mentioned earlier that you listen to a whole lot of music, so who would your 'go to' artist be right now?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT:</strong> Good question. I'm not sure, I don't really have a 'go to' person at the moment. It's all really about playlists for me. Let's see what my computer says.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><em>Oliver clicked on his computer and opened his iTunes, and proceeded to read off his most recently played tracks. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0</em></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>Lil' Wayne</strong>, <strong>Curren$y</strong>,<strong> Javelin</strong>, <strong>Jurrasic 5</strong>, <strong>Eminem</strong>, <strong>Snoop Dogg</strong>, <strong>Kendrick Lamar</strong>, <strong>Hudson Mohawk</strong>, <strong>Moby</strong>, <strong>Flying Lotus</strong>, <strong>Dr. Dre</strong>, <strong>Apparat</strong>, <strong>Ratatat</strong>, <strong>Wu Tang</strong>, <strong>Missy Elliot</strong>, <strong>Metronomy</strong>, <strong>M.I.A</strong>. <em>\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\xA6At this point we both started laughing. Here I was expecting once again she sort of suave playlist, but almost opposite of my expectations Oliver listened to an eclectic mix of beat-driven music, the majority of which falls under the category of \\\\\"Pop Rap\\\\\" which I personally can't stand. This was extremely unexpected and hilarious, and we both knew it\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\xA6. </em><strong>Lil' Kim</strong>, <strong>Kid Cudi</strong>, <strong>Jay-Z</strong>, <strong>Fatboy Slim</strong>, <strong>Drake</strong>, <strong>Four Tet</strong>, <strong>NWA</strong>, <strong>N.E.R.D.</strong>, some of my own tunes, and some <strong>Busta Rhymes</strong> as well.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>It's so funny, because as I'd imagine pretty much anyone when they think of Oliver Tank and what you listen is not going to list down Missy Elliot and Busta Rhymes <em>(Laughs)</em>.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT:</strong> Busta Rhymes man, he's making a comeback <em>(laughs)</em>.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><img title=\\\\\"Oliver Tank Banner 4\\\\\" src=\\\\\"http://i.imgur.com/6sLrM.jpg\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"Oliver Tank Banner 4\\\\\" width=\\\\\"640\\\\\" height=\\\\\"213\\\\\" /></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <blockquote>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p ><em><strong>\\\\\"The fact that people actually enjoy my music and that I'm sewn to get all of these great opportunities with it is just like, a dream come true.\\\\\"</strong></em></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </blockquote>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-align: left;\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>Americans have this sort of fantastic image in our heads that every Australian knows how to wrestle crocodiles and wears snakeskin boots. While this is certainly an overblown exaggeration, there is some truth to it in the fact that Australia certainly has some more vicious creatures than we do over her. Now Sydney certainly isn't the outback, but do you have any outrageous or hilarious stories from encounters with wildlife?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-align: left;\\\\\"><strong>OT:</strong> There are these things in Australia called hornets -- New Orleans Hornets <em>(laughs)</em> -- Yeah they're like giant wasps. One of my mates got attacked by a swarm of those the other day, which I dunno, might not really be that impressive. There's not like shark attacks or anything that have happened to me. I don't really ever go camping or anything like that, I sort of just stay around Sydney and there's nothing really that hectic here. People have this idea that Australia is just like, there's Kangaroos hopping around everywhere, and it's just not true. I mean, it is true in the middle of Australia, but not in places like Sydney.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM:</strong> I know you mentioned you listened Simon &amp; Garfunkel and Michael Jackson as a kid. Was there anyone, perhaps your parents or a friend that really helped pave the way for you in music?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT:</strong> I think my parents, when I was young, encouraged me to get involved in the school band. They've always been supportive of whatever sort of avenue I've decided to take with music. I suppose this one has really been the most successful, everything before was just sort of me playing in like shitty rock bands and stuff. I remember when I was in year 6 I had a family friend named Hendrick come over from Germany. He had just started playing guitar so he brought a guitar over here. I was about 11 and always hassling him to see if I could play it and he was always like \\\\\"Yeah man, play it whenever you'd like.\\\\\" That really got me into guitar, I guess I have him to thank because I've stuck with guitar the whole way. Even the music I'm making now I still try and use guitar in just because it's an instrument that I grew up with and that I know how to play.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\">I know how to use production software, Midis and whatever, but I think you always need sort of a real instrument in there, not only to maintain interest but to make it something that people can relate to. You don't want it to be too far off, and people aren't going to always understand these weird sounds you can get from a computer. I think you always need a real instrument, whether it be piano or guitar or vocals. What I'm doing is mixing real instrument sounds with electronic sounds. You can hear it in a lot of my tracks, there's always this element of synths or bass, but I try and contrast that with some clean vocals or guitar or some violins. Something that's real that people can relate to.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><div class=\\\\\"player-links\\\\\">\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"track-single page-feed\\\\\">\\\\n          <a href=\\\\\"http://files2.earmilk.com/tracks/MjAxMi0wMi8wNCBJIExvdmUgWW91Lm1wMw==.mp3\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link download\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Download\\\\\">\\\\n        Download<span></span>\\\\n      </a>\\\\n                        <a href=\\\\\"#play\\\\\" class=\\\\\"player-link play track\\\\\" id=\\\\\"link75481-4\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Play\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('75481-4');return false;\\\\\">\\\\n      Play<span></span>\\\\n    </a>\\\\n    <span class=\\\\\"player-link-title\\\\\" id=\\\\\"title75481-4\\\\\" onclick=\\\\\"togglePlayById('75481-4');return false;\\\\\"><span class=\\\\\"artist\\\\\">Oliver Tank</span> - I Love You <span class='time'>(03:17)</span></span>\\\\n  </div>\\\\n  <div class=\\\\\"clear\\\\\"></div>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </div><h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>We all know you as a musician, and that sounds like the majority of what you do. When you're hanging out with your friends I'd imagine there's something more to it than \\\\\"Oh let's go hang out with Oliver, he's really good at music.\\\\\" What do you friends know about you that are sort of your hidden talents that people would be interested in knowing about?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT:</strong> When I hang out with my friends I'm usually just drinking or smoking or having a good time. My friends don't call me Oliver as well--</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>Yeah I was going to ask -- Is that your real name or just an alias you came up with?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT: </strong>No, no that's my real name. Although it is some stupid ass name that some musician would think to name their band as <em>(laughs)</em>. My friends just call me Tank, as do most people. Originally when I started making music, as I do now, I was just calling myself Tank but then I changed it to Oliver Tank because I think it's a bit more memorable, I suppose.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\">Yeah I dunno I don't have any secret talents or anything, when I'm with my friends we really just hang out. I do play a bit of my music when I'm around my friends because I really enjoy it and hope they do as well\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\xA6 But sometimes I just force it upon them <em>(laughs)</em> like, \\\\\"I have to show you this new track!\\\\\" and then I just slam it at them. I do always like to get their opinion before I put the music out, just because I value it. Like my buddy Dave over here, I showed him all of the tracks from the EP months before it came out and he was telling me what he thought of them. If he didn't like something or thought something should b changed he'd let me know, and then if I agreed I'd change it.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>You mentioned earlier that you play basketball with people?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT:</strong> Yeah, not that often. I just got back into actually, but I've been going like twice a week. My buddy Dave over here likes the Lakers, but I don't really follow it as much as I enjoy shooting around with my mates.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>Go Bulls! Yes, but moving back to your music, talk to me a bit about this single we're premiering.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT:</strong> It's called \\\\\"Help You Breath.\\\\\" It's mostly about my love for music. It's unlike anything else - it's not really something that people need to know. I don't know, maybe some people don't know to do it.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>You're talking about breathing?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT:</strong> Yeah <em>(laughs).</em></h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM: </strong>Yeah I'd say it's pretty vital.\\\\xC2\\\\xA0</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><img src=\\\\\"http://i.imgur.com/bxL1p.jpg\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"Oliver Tank Banner 3\\\\\" width=\\\\\"640\\\\\" height=\\\\\"213\\\\\" /></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <blockquote>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p ><em><strong>\\\\xC2\\\\xA0\\\\\"I don't try and sound like anyone else, but I definitely draw influences from bands. It's just original music which I think is really accessible.\\\\\"</strong></em></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </blockquote>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 style=\\\\\"text-align: left;\\\\\"><strong>OT:</strong> Yeah it's pretty much what the song's about. It sort of refers to itself, as in the song acknowledges that it's a song which is something that I hadn't looked at before. It think it's pretty original, and probably one of the best tracks I've done. You can tell my production's gotten a lot better since I started working on Dreams. That'll probably be the main difference between that EP and this new mixtape and the upcoming EP. You'll be able to tell that the production's gotten a lot better but I'm not too detached from what I've already done.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 style=\\\\\"text-align: left;\\\\\">I think part of my sound and part of the reason people like me is that there's sort of an amateur vibe to it. I think I have a long way to go in my production, but I think that sort of helps me as an artist. I think that it's more relatable to people who are interested in making music. It's liberating to know that you can do it in your bedroom and have people like it, and I think that I'm gonna try and keep it that way for as long as I can.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM:</strong> That's one of the things that really irks me right now about the music industry. There are so many artists out that that are just focused on the money, and granted you do need to focus on money because if you don't have any you're not going to be living very well, but you shouldn't let that dictate how you operate as an artist. From what I've observed, what often happens these bands -- even some of the bands that I've worked with since I started with EARMILK -- you know they'll sell out to a big record label and end up moving away from that sort of hometown vibe that we all fell in love with and then it's just like it's not even the same band. So let's say Oliver Tank signs up with some big record label, but doesn't make sure his contract provides artistic integrity. Well the next thing you know he's got a new album that he brings to the people at his label and they take it and completely rework it so it will 'sell better' and Oliver has no choice but to go along with it. I hate that shit, and it's really good to hear from artists like yourself who aim to always maintain their original vision.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT: </strong>Yeah, like I'll always maintain artistic integrity, I'm not really signed with anyone particularly. No one really tells me how to make my music, so I just do it how I like, which is nice.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-question\\\\\"><strong>EM:</strong> I would hesitate to even call your sound amateur, because while it certainly doesn't sound like Paul McCartney produced it, it also doesn't come across as a piece of work by someone who didn't know what they were doing. You mentioned that you've drawn interest from artists like James Blake, Boards of Canada, etc. What is it about those artists that taps into your interest more than the rest?</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <h6 class=\\\\\"post-answer\\\\\"><strong>OT:</strong> I think, particularly with Boards of Canada, it's just such a unique sound and I really dug it. It was different than anything I've ever heard before. The Boards of Canada track \\\\\"Dayvan Cowboy\\\\\" is so original but so easy to listen to. James Blake's first EP is also ridiculously good. I guess I started to hear stuff and I was just like, wow. I didn't know music could be like this, and that's sort of what inspired me. That's what I try to do with my music, is make something original that people haven't heard before. I don't try and sound like anyone else, but I definitely draw influences from bands. It's just original music which I think is really accessible.</h6>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <hr />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><img class=\\\\\"alignleft\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Oliver T square\\\\\" src=\\\\\"http://i.imgur.com/SfmbW.jpg\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" width=\\\\\"300\\\\\" height=\\\\\"300\\\\\" />There is no true requisite in this world for fame, because in the end it comes down mostly to luck. Yet if the world has any sense left in it, we'll all break away from the bandwagon and pay attention to Oliver Tank and artists like him, who are here for the music and nothing else. Oliver is currently touring around Sydney, and mentioned to me that he has plans to eventually make it over to the states. His music is truly something unique, and can serve as an exceptionally effective solution for almost any occasion -- whether that being interrupting an awkward silence or busting out james on your Nokia n9.\\\\xC2\\\\xA0Stay in tuned to <strong>EARMILK</strong> for the latest updates on Oliver, and to capitalize on a some free hipster cred, follow Oliver Tank on his social networks for \\\\\"I knew him before he was big\\\\\" perks.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <ul>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <li><a href=\\\\\"http://www.facebook.com/olivertankmusic\\\\\"><strong>Oliver Tank on Facebook</strong></a></li>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <li><strong><a href=\\\\\"https://twitter.com/#!/olivertank\\\\\">Oliver Tank on Twitter</a></strong></li>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <li><strong><a href=\\\\\"http://soundcloud.com/oliver-tank\\\\\">Oliver Tank on Soundcloud</a></strong></li>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </ul><img src=\\\\\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/earmilk/~4/zp38094OT2g\\\\\" height=\\\\\"1\\\\\" width=\\\\\"1\\\\\"/>\"\\n  entry_id: http://www.earmilk.com/2012/02/18/earmilk-presents-oliver-tank-interview-review-exclusive/\\n  published: 2012-02-18 19:39:28 Z\\n  summary: \" Fame is a fickle food upon a shifting plate.

I don't need a f**kin' suit to enjoy music</em>.) After some negotiations, I made it in the door. I sat down at the Interscope table and was introduced to Isaac, Thorald and Shakerleg - better known collectively as <strong>The Kin</strong>. My initial reaction was, \\\\\"<em>Why the fuck are your hands covered in tape?!</em>\\\\\" Because the drummer is so badass, he doesn't even need drumsticks. He'll cut his hands open on the cymbals, slamming them home. Why? He's a honey badger. He doesn't give a fuck.

The singers are brothers from Australia, and they harmonize like you just cannot understand. It sounds... perfect. When they took the stage, everyone stopped what they were doing and listened. I liked it, but something just wasn't right. I could tell these guys were out of their element. It was just too clean. The W was the wrong venue. These guys were a gritty rock band, and they needed a rock atmosphere. Something more intimate...</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>Fast forward to Valentine's Day: I pulled up to Sayer's Club in Hollywood with my business partner Will. Sayer's Club is an odd venue, mostly because it doesn't really look like a club. On the outside, it's a smoothie joint. Then you're led through a back door to a nightclub like no other nightclub I have ever stepped foot in (<a href=\\\\\"http://i.imgur.com/04dKB.jpg\\\\\">picture</a>). It is literally the most beautiful bar, intimate stage, and genuine feeling venue I have ever heard live music in. If you ever get the chance when you're in Hollywood, get dressed up all pretty, get your \\\\\"hurr did\\\\\", and head to Sayer's... <em>ANYWAY</em>...</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>I walked into the club and was met by Barry and James, The Kin's A&amp;R. James is the nephew of music industry legend Jimmy Iovine. He's the guy responsible for getting The Kin signed to a six record contract with Interscope. Yes, you read that correctly. Six records. In a day and age when you're lucky to get two or three, The Kin got six. From Interscope. That's not just something that happens. Ever. The Kin is <em>THAT</em> good.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>James and I talked about The Kin a bit more, then he bought me a drink. Or six. Fuck, I don't remember. Anyway, thanks James. I ended up in the corner booth with the band. My friend Will and I talked with the guys about music, influences, and pizza. As it turns out, \\\\xC2\\\\xA0the guys and I both love Two Boots on Bleeker Street in the Lower East Side. Then it was time for them to take the stage.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>That's when everything clicked. They started playing, and it was (to pull a Drew Barrymore line) \\\\\"magical, just magical\\\\\". Not like, weird, Harry Potter magic - good magic. Instantly, I realized what Barry and James were telling me about. The Kin are a mix of <strong>The Black Keys, Coldplay, Eric Clapton</strong>, and 1950's blues. Everything just works. The brothers jam away, while the drummer slams his bare hands in a frenzy. (Seriously though, I hope this guy can keep his fingers attached for six albums.) It's soulful and gritty, like cutting a filet mignon with a rusty samurai sword.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>Currently, The Kin are working on their album. After their set on Valentine's Day, they headed back to New York to rest and play some more shows. In a week and a half, I'll be meeting back up with them in Los Angeles, at my office in the basement of Lion Heart Creative. There, the band is planning on recording some music with my partner (<em>and producer/engineer freak-of-nature</em>) Will Edwards, and maybe, if I ask the folks at Interscope really nicely, they'll let me leak a song or two here on Earmilk. (Wink wink. Nudge nudge.)</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>Keep your eyes on The Kin.

This is a quick inside look at Porter Robinson, showing his thoughts on how people react to music, a breakdown of what he has in store with his live sets, outlook on touring, past thoughts on making &#8220;the most exciting drop ever&#8221;, and his 2 goals in making music. His <em>Spitfire</em> album has been incredibly\\\\xC2\\\\xA0successful, (listen to the whole thing below), and he&#8217;s been touring with countless big names like Skrillex, Tiesto, Zedd, and a ton more. This really is the year for Porter.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><a href=\\\\\"http://thissongissick.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Porter-Robinson-DJ-Interview-TSIS.jpg\\\\\"><img class=\\\\\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12049\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Porter-Robinson-DJ-Interview-TSIS\\\\\" src=\\\\\"http://thissongissick.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Porter-Robinson-DJ-Interview-TSIS.jpg\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" width=\\\\\"338\\\\\" height=\\\\\"202\\\\\" /></a></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>Porter states how his original goal was to make &#8220;the most exciting drop ever&#8221;. then moves onto his admiration for hyper detailed music from artists like <strong>Wolfgang Gartner</strong> and <strong>Noisia</strong>, but liked how &#8220;hard and danceable they kept they&#8217;re music&#8221;. He ends with his conclusion for his outlook on making music &#8220;Fuck everything else except for those two goals, I want to be <strong>complex</strong>, \\\\xC2\\\\xA0and I want it to be <strong>agressive</strong>.&#8221; \\\\xC2\\\\xA0He certainly does both of those so well, and been doing nothing but making HUGE waves since the interview. It was a great pleasure to sit down with Porter, and it&#8217;s really amazing to see how big he is getting, and how fast.

Before forming a duo in early 2011, were you guys already friends, or just two guys who met, had things in common and decided to make music together?</strong></p><p>We've been friends since high school, involved in a bunch of different musical projects. However, we only decided to have a go at EDM music in 2011.<br /> We got tired of lugging guitars, amps, drums around. Now, we just sit in a basement, drinking embarrassing amounts of energy dranks... (Energy drink sponsorship anyone?) and yes, we know they're terrible for you. We're actually super neurotic health freaks, but since we started this Adventure Club, we kind of let some of that slip...</p><p><strong>2. How did you guys get discovered? Can I even ask this? =]</strong></p><p>If I could write in exact detail how it kind of came together, I would. However, we weren't planning on, it just came along as we kept releasing songs.<br /> We sent songs to blogs, youtube channels, a couple picked them up. Slowly, more friendly internet people starting posting our traxxx everywhere.<br /> Love the internet.</p><p><strong>3. Some hip hop artists are heavily influenced by Bruce Lee and Kung fu movies, what are your inspirations when it comes to making music with unique and distinct sounds?</strong></p><p>Jayden Jaymes, Flux Pavillion, anddd Pop pUnk.</p><p><strong>4. How would you describe yourself in one word? (Leighton = ?) (Christian = ?)</strong></p><p>Christian = Expecto Patronum<br /> Leighton = Rictusempra</p><p><strong>7. You guys seem busy lately, what have you been up too?</strong></p><p>Our touring schedule has been filling out quite nicely lately, that along with school, writing music and girlfriends.<br /> Having a decent social life with our friends is tough. Lol@sleeping.</p><p><strong>8. Lastly, if I gave you two plane tickets to anywhere in the world, where would you guys go? And why?</strong></p><p>A Bali beach. Cause it's a Bali beach. But it would have to be a sunny Bali beach. gloomy Bali beaches suck.<br /> When do we get our tickets?</p><p><strong>Interviewer's Ending Comments:</strong> I've followed Adventure Club since the beginning, and was hooked when I heard their distinct style! I remembered being there when some random guy on Youtube was claiming their tracks as his own and people actually believed that guy, that's how far back Adventure Club had been. Now they are a super success, and it's only a matter of time before they become well-known heavyweights like Skrillex. I had a blast doing an interview with these two and wish them the very best. <strong>Maybe one day I will be able to afford to buy them two tickets to Bali, or maybe they can buy me one. =]<br /> </strong><br /> <strong>Adventure Club Official Links:</strong><br /> <a rel=\\\\\"nofollow\\\\\" href=\\\\\"facebook.com/adventureclubdub\\\\\">Facebook</a><br /> <a rel=\\\\\"nofollow\\\\\" href=\\\\\"http://twitter.com/adventuredub\\\\\">Twitter</a><br /> <a rel=\\\\\"nofollow\\\\\" href=\\\\\"http://youtube.com/adventureclubdubstep\\\\\">YouTube</a><br /> <a rel=\\\\\"nofollow\\\\\" href=\\\\\"http://soundcloud.com/adventureclubdubstep\\\\\">Soundcloud</a></p><p><strong>Adventure Clubs's sickest traxxx:</strong></p><p>Flight Facilities - Crave You (Adventure Club Dubstep Remix)<br /> <object type=\\\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\\\" data=\\\\\"http://dubstepremix.org/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/assets/player.swf\\\\\" height=24 width='400'><param name=\\\\\"movie\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://dubstepremix.org/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/assets/player.swf\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"FlashVars\\\\\" value=\\\\\"soundFile=http://hulkshare.com/ap-2xocyb96kpwq&#038;titles=Flight Facilities - Crave You (Adventure Club Dubstep Remix)VC_DubstepRemix.Org.mp3\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"quality\\\\\" value=\\\\\"high\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"menu\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"wmode\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\"></object></p><p>Thrice - Broken Lungs (Adventure Club Dubstep Remix)<br /> <object type=\\\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\\\" data=\\\\\"http://dubstepremix.org/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/assets/player.swf\\\\\" height=24 width='400'><param name=\\\\\"movie\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://dubstepremix.org/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/assets/player.swf\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"FlashVars\\\\\" value=\\\\\"soundFile=http://hulkshare.com/ap-ahavwlbnsbt9&#038;titles=Thrice - Broken Lungs (Adventure Club Dubstep Remix)VCM_DubstepRemix.Org.mp3\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"quality\\\\\" value=\\\\\"high\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"menu\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"wmode\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\"></object></p><p>Britney Spears - Till the World Ends (Adventure Club Dubstep Remix)<br /> <object type=\\\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\\\" data=\\\\\"http://dubstepremix.org/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/assets/player.swf\\\\\" height=24 width='400'><param name=\\\\\"movie\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://dubstepremix.org/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/assets/player.swf\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"FlashVars\\\\\" value=\\\\\"soundFile=http://hulkshare.com/ap-yg3318anumy4&#038;titles=Britney Spears - Till the World Ends (Adventure Club Dubstep Remix)V_DubstepRemix.Org.mp3\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"quality\\\\\" value=\\\\\"high\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"menu\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"wmode\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\"></object></p><p><BR><BR><BR><br /> Adventure Club's interview conducted exclusively by <a href=\\\\\"http://dubstepremix.org\\\\\" rel=\\\\\"dofollow\\\\\">DubstepRemix.Org</a>!</p> \"\\n  entry_id: http://dubstepremix.org/?p=3508\\n  published: 2011-10-24 03:54:26 Z\\n  summary: Interview with Adventure Club conducted by DubstepRemix.Org on October 23rd, 2011. 1.

And the world?</strong></p><p>to be honest i have been really immersed in the california bass music scene and haven't gotten to travel too far out of california, but i can definitely say that the california bass music scene is totally big and thriving and moving in a million different directions at once. there are so many talented producers and dj's out here as well as amazing crews who put huge amounts of time and energy and love into manifesting some really amazing gatherings. it is totally inspiring and exciting to get to be part of it all!</p><p><strong>4) Do you know of any other Dubstep producers from Cali worth mentioning?</strong></p><p>yeah absolutely! california has a huge bass music scene and there are way too many amazing producers to even begin to name them all... minnesota is a really dope producer also out of santa cruz who makes really beautiful bass music at a bunch of different tempos, another favorite of mine is megalodon, a crew out of berkeley who produce some really clean, heavy dubs... also one of my favorite producers/dj's these days is dov, who runs muti music. his dj sets are by far some of the best i've ever gotten to see, he spins a super eclectic mix of seriously next level bass music at every imaginable tempo and style... super inspiring to say the least!</p><p><strong>5) What's something not a lot of people know about you?</strong></p><p>i'm a vegan <img src='http://dubstepremix.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=\\\\\"icon smile Grizzly J Interview\\\\\" class='wp-smiley' title=\\\\\"Grizzly J Interview photo\\\\\" /></p><p><strong>6) And whats the craziest thing you've ever done in your life?</strong></p><p>hmmm, it is difficult to say... i definitely had some crazy experiences at burning man this year!</p><p><strong>7) And our final question for this interview is if you could change one thing about this world? What would it be?</strong></p><p>i don't know! there are a lot of things about the world i'd like to change.... i guess i'd probably first just want to make sure everyone has food and water!</p><p><strong>Interviewer's Ending Comments:</strong> Grizzly is definitely one of my favorite producers, and is a California product that I'm very proud of! Producing some of my personally favorite tracks. I love love melodies, sweet 420, addictive synths and 8bit sounds, and Grizzly J definitely incorporates all of these into his music! Maybe its the California Bass thing. =]</p><p><strong>Grizzly J Official Links:</strong><br /> <a rel=\\\\\"nofollow\\\\\" href=\\\\\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Grizzly-J/139646566095668\\\\\">Facebook</a><br /> <a rel=\\\\\"nofollow\\\\\" href=\\\\\"http://soundcloud.com/grizzly-j\\\\\">Soundcloud</a></p><p><strong>Grizzly J's dopest tunes:</strong></p><p>Witness - Farewell (Grizzly J Bootleg)<br /> <object width=\\\\\"400\\\\\" height=\\\\\"24\\\\\" type=\\\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\\\" data=\\\\\"http://dubstepremix.org/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/assets/player.swf\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"movie\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://dubstepremix.org/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/assets/player.swf\\\\\" /><param name=\\\\\"FlashVars\\\\\" value=\\\\\"soundFile=http://hulkshare.com/ap-z1ruafgg3suz&amp;titles=Witness - Farewell (Grizzly J Bootleg)MC_[www.DubstepRemix.Org].mp3\\\\\" /><param name=\\\\\"quality\\\\\" value=\\\\\"high\\\\\" /><param name=\\\\\"menu\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\" /><param name=\\\\\"wmode\\\\\" /></object></p><p>Sexual Prey - Ground (Grizzly J Remix)<br /> <object type=\\\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\\\" data=\\\\\"http://dubstepremix.org/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/assets/player.swf\\\\\" height=24 width='400'><param name=\\\\\"movie\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://dubstepremix.org/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/assets/player.swf\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"FlashVars\\\\\" value=\\\\\"soundFile=http://hulkshare.com/ap-xhxmw8mod8qe&#038;titles=Sexual Prey - Ground (Grizzly J Remix)MC_DubstepRemix.Org(2).mp3\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"quality\\\\\" value=\\\\\"high\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"menu\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"wmode\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\"></object></p><p>Grizzly J - 420 Dubstep Mixtape<br /> <object type=\\\\\"application/x-shockwave-flash\\\\\" data=\\\\\"http://dubstepremix.org/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/assets/player.swf\\\\\" height=24 width='400'><param name=\\\\\"movie\\\\\" value=\\\\\"http://dubstepremix.org/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/assets/player.swf\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"FlashVars\\\\\" value=\\\\\"soundFile=http://hulkshare.com/ap-1g6avbb9psgs&#038;titles=Grizzly J - 420 Dubstep Mixtape.mp3\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"quality\\\\\" value=\\\\\"high\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"menu\\\\\" value=\\\\\"false\\\\\"><param name=\\\\\"wmode\\\\\" value=\\\\\"\\\\\"></object></p><p><BR><BR><BR><br /> Grizzly J's interview conducted exclusively by <a href=\\\\\"http://dubstepremix.org\\\\\" rel=\\\\\"dofollow\\\\\">DubstepRemix.Org</a>!</p> \"\\n  entry_id: http://dubstepremix.org/?p=3492\\n  published: 2011-10-21 03:48:16 Z\\n  summary: Interview with Grizzly J conducted by DubstepRemix.Org on October 10th, 2011. 1) How did you hear about dubstep, and how did you get started in it? i think i first heard about dubstep from a friend of mine who was showing me a lot of glitch hop. at that point i was producing a bunch [...]\\n  title: Grizzly J Interview\\n  url: http://dubstepremix.org/grizzly-j-interview\\n- !ruby/object:Feedzirra::Parser::RSSEntry \\n  author: Novex\\n  categories: \\n  - Dubstep Remixes\\n  - Filthy BASSFACE\\n  - Zero G\\n  content: \"<div class=\\\\\"tweetmeme_button\\\\\" style=\\\\\"float: right; margin-left: 10px;\\\\\"> <a rel=\\\\\"nofollow\\\\\" href=\\\\\"http://api.tweetmeme.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdubstepremix.org%2Fzero-g-ransom-original-dubstep-mix\\\\\"><br /> <img src=\\\\\"http://api.tweetmeme.com/imagebutton.gif?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdubstepremix.org%2Fzero-g-ransom-original-dubstep-mix&amp;style=normal&amp;b=2\\\\\" height=\\\\\"61\\\\\" width=\\\\\"50\\\\\" title=\\\\\"Zero G   Ransom (Original Dubstep Mix) photo\\\\\" alt=\\\\\" Zero G   Ransom (Original Dubstep Mix)\\\\\" /><br /> </a></div><p>So I was just going through my collection of Dub tunes.

Among our haul was&nbsp;Justin Peroff's debut effort, <i>Tape One</i>, as Junior Pande (as opposed to Broken Social Scene, with whom he drums) and a receipt for (our preordered copy of) prolific Canadian underground producer Don Cash's latest album, <i>Epic, </i>courtesy of the newly launched <a href=\"http://www.springbreaktapes.com/\">Spring Break Tapes</a>.&nbsp;Peroff's ambient beats and noise cocktails on <i>Tape One </i>are a powerful combination with Cash's eclectic repertoire, the one captivatingly elegant and the other&nbsp;unrepentantly&nbsp;experimental, careening across the range of contemporary and retro art rock and hip hop.

People's \"traditional listening\" holidays seems to vary radically and the risk of sounding sappy seems to be something near the top of a lot of minds, so I've tended to find a lot of the really good Christmas mixes out there, are also tremendously short. Ages ago, Jheri made a five song <a href=\"http://getoffthecoast.blogspot.com/2009/12/christmas-off-coast.html\">Christmas mixtape</a> that was pretty rad (in spite of it's&nbsp;grotesquely&nbsp;unseasonable cover). Last year, Jakub Alexander - the music curator for <a href=\"http://blog.iso50.com/\">ISO50</a> and the man behind <a href=\"http://moodgadget.com/\">Moodgadget</a> - put together such a mix for the former, composed of only six songs.

The track is just brilliant enough to have me asking for an Ashanti comeback (though maybe with less Irv Gotti at her back.)<br /></div><br />MP3: <a href=\\\\\"http://soundcloud.com/frenchexpress/sets/perseus\\\\\">Perseus - <span style=\\\\\"font-style: italic;\\\\\">Russian Girlfriends EP</span></a><br /><a href=\\\\\"http://jherievans.com/mp3/Perseus%20-%20Cool%20Runnings.mp3\\\\\">01 Cool Runnings</a><br /><a href=\\\\\"http://jherievans.com/mp3/Perseus%20-%20Russian%20Girlfriends.mp3\\\\\">02 Russian Girlfriends</a><br /><a href=\\\\\"http://jherievans.com/mp3/Perseus%20-%20Running%20Back%20To%20You.mp3\\\\\">03 Running Back To You</a><br /><span style=\\\\\"font-size:85%;\\\\\">Head over to <a href=\\\\\"http://soundcloud.com/themagician/magic-tape-eighteen\\\\\">Soundcloud</a> to check out <span style=\\\\\"font-style: italic;\\\\\">Magic Tape Eighteen</span>, as well as any of the previous <span style=\\\\\"font-style: italic;\\\\\">Magic Tapes</span>.</span><div class=\\\\\"blogger-post-footer\\\\\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6368624826228121298-2152063073234165680?l=getoffthecoast.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>\"\\n  title: Russian Girlfriends\\n  url: http://getoffthecoast.blogspot.com/2011/12/russian-girlfriends.html\\n- !ruby/object:Feedzirra::Parser::RSSEntry \\n  author: noreply@blogger.com (Jheri Evans)\\n  categories: \\n  - Fear Of Men\\n  entry_id: tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6368624826228121298.post-8391547394996330784\\n  published: 2011-12-21 15:55:00 Z\\n  summary: \"<iframe src=\\\\\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/33960550?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\\\\\" webkitallowfullscreen=\\\\\"\\\\\" mozallowfullscreen=\\\\\"\\\\\" allowfullscreen=\\\\\"\\\\\" frameborder=\\\\\"0\\\\\" height=\\\\\"236\\\\\" width=\\\\\"420\\\\\"></iframe><br /><div style=\\\\\"text-align: right;\\\\\"><span style=\\\\\"font-size:85%;\\\\\">[director: <a href=\\\\\"http://vimeo.com/fearofmen\\\\\">Natalie Gravy</a>]</span><br /></div><br /><div style=\\\\\"text-align: justify;\\\\\"><span style=\\\\\"font-size:85%;\\\\\">\\\\\"Doldrums\\\\\" is from the </span><span style=\\\\\"font-style:italic;font-size:85%;\\\\\" >Alice Munroe Demos</span><span style=\\\\\"font-size:85%;\\\\\"> tape, which is unfortunately already sold out.

Silky's beat on this one is subdued, relying on the minimal yet hazy vibe he's becoming more and more known for. Farrar jumps hard on the beat, starting things off with a slow paced recanting of his own dealings with the Devil. As the beat gains energy so does Farrar, shaking off any hesitations before speaking about the twisted ways of governments. Emilio Rojas also impresses on this one; this is the first I've heard from him and you can already count me as a fan. From the start of his verse he goes in hard with a \\\\\"fuck everything, I came to get mine\\\\\" attitude. The point is certainly proven, in the end we all want more than just a piece of the Devil's pie.<br /></div><br />MP3: <span style=\\\\\"font-size:85%;\\\\\"><a href=\\\\\"http://jherievans.com/mp3/Deniro%20Farrar%20x%20Emilio%20Rojas%20-%20Devil%27s%20Pie%20%28Fuck%20The%20Slice%29.mp3\\\\\">Deniro Farrar x Emilio Rojas - Devil's Pie (Fuck The Slice)</a></span><div class=\\\\\"blogger-post-footer\\\\\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6368624826228121298-4020106579482926229?l=getoffthecoast.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>\"\\n  title: Devil's Pie (Fuck The Slice)\\n  url: http://getoffthecoast.blogspot.com/2011/12/devils-pie-fuck-slice.html\\n- !ruby/object:Feedzirra::Parser::RSSEntry \\n  author: noreply@blogger.com (Jheri Evans)\\n  categories: \\n  - changemod\\n  - Deniro Farrar\\n  - L.W.H.\\n  - Ryan Hemsworth\\n  - Julian Wass\\n  - Clams Casino\\n  - Oxykitten\\n  - Crash Symbols\\n  - Ghibli\\n  - Main Attrakionz\\n  - Emily Reo\\n  - Ricky Eat Acid\\n  - Brown Bread\\n  - Gahza\\n  - Kam3L3iN\\n  entry_id: tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6368624826228121298.post-2332706228475153594\\n  published: 2011-12-19 17:00:00 Z\\n  summary: \"<a onblur=\\\\\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\\\\\" href=\\\\\"http://crashsymbols.bandcamp.com/album/dope-mountain-fuck-vol-2\\\\\"><img style=\\\\\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 400px;\\\\\" src=\\\\\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-is9CnqL3nsI/Tu9su1n-vGI/AAAAAAAAC3g/8s4v81-QHeM/s400/dmf2v2.png\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" id=\\\\\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5687884406316776546\\\\\" border=\\\\\"0\\\\\" /></a><div style=\\\\\"text-align: justify;\\\\\">About a year-and-a-half ago I first met Dwight and his then girlfriend Liz while touring with <a href=\\\\\"http://borngold.us/\\\\\">Born Gold</a> (then Gobble Gobble). It was obvious from the first handshake that I had just discovered two of my best friends in the most unlikely of places, West Virginia. It was upon this first meeting while smoking a bowl on the front porch that the idea of <a href=\\\\\"http://crashsymbols.tumblr.com/\\\\\">Crash Symbols</a> was born. Fast forward to now; we've released around twenty tapes, our first vinyl release (both a 12\\\\\" and a 7\\\\\"), plus Dwight and Liz got married! The three of us couldn't be happier with everything we've accomplished in so little time. To celebrate we bring to you today the second volume of our inaugural mixtape, <span style=\\\\\"font-style:italic;\\\\\">Dope Mountain Fuck</span>. With just as much energy and twice the confidence, DMFv2 is a symbol of achievement for us.

We were lucky enough to see Twin Steps perform at a house show in Oakland a few months ago, and we've been huge fans since. Their music is a bit hard to classify (it's been called \\\\\"violent soul\\\\\" and \\\\\"thrashwave\\\\\"), but whatever genre it may be a part of, these songs are really, really, really good. Of the four tracks and two \\\\\"interludes\\\\\" on the album, my favorite is probably \\\\\"Pinkie Promise\\\\\" -- it's just over six minutes of blissful, updated 60s pop, a few samples, and Drew's idiosyncratically perfect vocals, all punctuated in the middle by a musical car crash of sorts. This is one of my favorite albums of the year, and I suggest listening to it when you're having a drink/smoke and feel like getting swept away by something strange and wonderful.</div><div style=\\\\\"text-align: justify; \\\\\"><br /></div><div style=\\\\\"text-align: justify; \\\\\">MP3 :: <a href=\\\\\"http://jherievans.com/mp3/Twin%20Steps%20-%20Pinkie%20Promise.mp3\\\\\">Twin Steps - Pinkie Promise</a></div><div style=\\\\\"text-align: justify; \\\\\">Buy the lovely 10\\\\\" vinyl right <a href=\\\\\"http://colabruin.bandcamp.com/album/twin-steps-serial-parade-10\\\\\">here</a>, and stream four of the six tracks <a href=\\\\\"http://twinsteps.bandcamp.com/\\\\\">over there</a> if you like.</div><div class=\\\\\"blogger-post-footer\\\\\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/6368624826228121298-378197783542648230?l=getoffthecoast.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>\"\\n  title: \"Premiere: Twin Steps - Pinkie Promise\"\\n  url: http://getoffthecoast.blogspot.com/2011/12/premiere-twin-steps-pinkie-promise.html\\n- !ruby/object:Feedzirra::Parser::RSSEntry \\n  author: noreply@blogger.com (Dwight Pavlovic)\\n  categories: \\n  - Gahza\\n  entry_id: tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-6368624826228121298.post-3129336676904493923\\n  published: 2011-12-12 23:12:00 Z\\n  summary: \"<a href=\\\\\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fDjLk84Ln4s/TuaIuPTurUI/AAAAAAAAAmE/IXsLli7dlx8/s1600/gahza.jpg\\\\\" onblur=\\\\\"try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}\\\\\"><img style=\\\\\"display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 400px;\\\\\" src=\\\\\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fDjLk84Ln4s/TuaIuPTurUI/AAAAAAAAAmE/IXsLli7dlx8/s400/gahza.jpg\\\\\" border=\\\\\"0\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" id=\\\\\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5685381907566472514\\\\\" /></a><div style=\\\\\"text-align: justify;\\\\\"><a href=\\\\\"http://gahza.bandcamp.com/\\\\\">Gahza</a> makes sped up pop of a character I'm definitely interested to hear further explored.

As composer and arranger, he created or recreated hundreds of songs; as progenitor, he found, groomed, and composed and performed alongside 161 Blue Grass Boys in a half century before sending them back out into the world to spread the gospel. </p>\\n    <p>According to interviews with the living members of that vast group, like an Old Master, his was the inspiration and vision, and &#8211; more often than not &#8211; the copyright went to him like a signature&#8217;s flourish.   Between 200 and 250 songs, most written in those heady formative years before the folk revival truly took off, are attributable to him in whole or in part.   And much as Dylan would later combine original craftsmanship with songs scavenged from the traditional folk songbook, Monroe&#8217;s work as an adapter of song reintroduced dozens of titles into the popular canon, giving these newly transformed tunes life through recordings and a ceaseless life of touring and performance.    </p>\\n    <p>But whether they were Bill&#8217;s songs to begin with or merely bore his mark is not the point.   Monroe served as a sort of lynchpin or nexus of protomusicology, pulling traditional fiddle tunes, back porch country, fieldhand and jump blues, the gospel hymnal, and old A.P. Carter folksongs into one broad, consistent genre, and then pouring hundreds of originals into the mix to stabilize it.  In the process, through careful development of both a style and a form, with well-defined instrumentation and performance standards, and the consistent perspective of the God-fearing working man, he created bluegrass, the genre he came to define.</p>\\n    <p>And as a vocalist and harmonizer, an innovative mandolin player, and a powerful, influential bandleader, he also laid the groundwork for rock-and-roll with his introduction of staccato rhythms and bass under fast melodic chorus-and-verse &#8211; an influence acknowledged in his posthumous induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.   </p>\\n    <p>So if we were to find a few songs of his beyond the bluegrass genre pool, it would not be such a surprise.  After all, Elvis made his mark on <em>Blue Moon of Kentucky</em> as the b-side to his very first Sun records single.   And even as it was the folk revivalists who sustained Monroe&#8217;s career during the sixties, arguably, it was that beat which Monroe brought to the music which ultimately found its way into Elvis&#8217; hips &#8211; and to the roots and folk revivalists from there.<br />\\n    <br/></p>\\n    <p>That said: though both are essentially different, folk and bluegrass have their overlap.   Taking on the songs of Bill Monroe without hitting the core of bluegrass itself is somewhat of a fake-out &#8211; bluegrass itself is a hybridized genre at heart; contemporary folk artists of all stripes like a good turn to the grassy side, and often have the banjos in their arsenal to prove it.    </p>\\n    <p>And, as we&#8217;ve noted above, the tendency towards song reclamation which Monroe undertook has a tendency to muddy the waters of authorship.  We&#8217;ll see some songs previously marked as traditional here, as seen in a number of Monroe tributes which mix traditional country and appalachian songs with those which bear his name, from Ricky Skaggs and Friends&#8217; <a href=\"http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/2899587/a/Sing+The+Songs+Of+Bill+Monroe.htm\">Big Mon</a> (2000), which features Bruce Hornsby taking lead on Darlin&#8217; Corey on a piano-jazz opening track, to Del McCoury&#8217;s fine 2011 tribute <a href=\"http://www.delmccouryband.com/releases/old-memories-the-songs-of-bill-monroe/\">Old Memories: The Songs of Bill Monroe</a>, which pretends only to play off of Del&#8217;s own memory of the man and the songs he came to own.   </p>\\n    <p>Musically, too, we could go broad here, and none would fault us.   But Monroe&#8217;s legacy is vast indeed, and any folkstream movement which would have his songbook turn out past the boundaries of Bluegrass itself honors both the man himself and his formative influence on music beyond genre definition.   So although it was tempting to sneak in a Sam Bush cover below, we&#8217;ll stick to a reasonable attempt at a narrow focus that is consistent with our core mission here at Cover Lay Down: a set of bands and solo musicians who self-identify primarily as folk or roots artists, rather than bluegrass artists, playing some of the songs which bear Monroe&#8217;s name as composer in the annals of BMI copyright.   </p>\\n    <p>From <a href=\"http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/my-name-is-buddy\">Ry Cooder</a>&#8216;s raucous roots and <a href=\"http://clumsylovers.com/music/make-yourself-known/\">The Clumsy Lovers</a>&#8216; high-energy cajunized folk rock to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HYC4EA/\">David Schnaufer</a>&#8216;s delicate dulcimer instrumentals; from <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/June-Bugg-Hootenanny-Folk-Festival/release/2136454\">June Bugg</a>&#8216;s early folk revivalism to <a href=\"http://www.johnmcgann.com/wayfaring.html\">The Wayfaring Strangers</a>&#8216; acoustic lounge jazz take on Hank Williams co-write <em>I&#8217;m Blue, I&#8217;m Lonesome</em>; from the lo-fi indiefolk of <a href=\"http://www.thediamondfamilyarchive.com/\">The Diamond Family Archive</a> to genre-crossing banjo, string, and guitar-driven takes from Cover Lay Down favorites <a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/category/red-molly/\">Red Molly</a>, <a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/category/crooked-still/\">Crooked Still</a>, and the <a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/2008/01/the-jones-street-boys-cover-the-band-john-hartford-bill-monroe-peter-rowan/\">Jones Street Boys</a>, the appalachian string music of <a href=\"http://www.darolanger.com/store/republic_of_strings.html\">Darol Anger</a>, and the old-timey fiddlework of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Heroes-Mark-OConnor/dp/B000002MJQ\">Mark O&#8217;Connor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/sadiec\">Sadie Compton</a>, this is Bill Monroe like you&#8217;ve never heard him before.

This year&#8217;s lineup is stellar as always, with young sensation Sierra Hull, Steve Martin touring and recording companions the Steep Canyon Rangers, new Boston-based all-girl quintet Della Mae, long-time fave the Clare Lynch Band, and special guest spots from banjo master Bill Keith and folk singer-songwriter Jonathan Edwards holding down a powerhouse three days of music.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>We&#8217;ve covered most of these artists before, so instead of fishing for some new angle, in honor of our sixth consecutive year at the fest, I&#8217;m reviving our 2008 post on the topic, along with a much expanded set of covergrass to whet your whistle for the days ahead.  Read on for some favorite covers from Joe Val mainstage performers past and present &#8211; and then pack up your mando, banjo, fiddle, dobro, guitar or bass and head on over to Joe Val!</i><br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <br/><br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <hr width=75%>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><br/><br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    In my heart, Bluegrass is the epitome of summer, calling up images of bare feet, hot sun, cold beer straight from the cooler, and warm outdoor nights pickin\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x99 tentside in the camps. And in most audiences, the genre is grounded in the geography of the American South, where summer lingers long and lazy \\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x93 both in the appalachian ranges which hold its old-timey roots, and in the country music of Grand Old Opryland which so supported its evolution.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>But there\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x99s plenty of good reasons why the Joe Val Bluegrass Festival \\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x93 an annual mid-winter event which celebrates the surprisingly strong New England bluegrass community, previously featured here in 2008 \\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x93 has won fan accolades and \\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x9Cbest fest\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x9D awards from the International Bluegrass Music Association. Crammed into a turreted Sheraton Tara, its conference room workshops, lobby picking circles, and grand ballroom mainstage sets defy all expectations \\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x93 and the Boston Bluegrass Union, who sponsor the event, deserve kudos for packing in enough time, energy and diversity to make for a grand and intimate experience.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>Though it\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a strong festival in its own right, I tend to approach Joe Val as a preview tour for discovery, a guide for what not to miss come July as I make my annual pilgrimage to Grey Fox. And it works: without fail, each time I have attended, I have come away excited about a few new discoveries, and this year\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x99s festival, which ended yesterday, was no exception.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>In six years of regular attendance, Joe Val has introduced me to The Infamous Stringdusters, The Steeldrivers, Sierra Hull, The Steep Canyon Rangers, and a plethora of other stringbands, gospel quartets, and high tenor crooners both new and old.  And unsurprisingly, many of these discoveries are driven by coverage \\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x93 after all, the Bluegrass canon is chock full of old standards, and the genre itself is intimately tied to the performances and songcraft of a finite handful of individuals, from The Carter Family to Flatt and Scruggs, from The Stanley Brothers to founding father Bill Monroe himself.<br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <br/><br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <hr width=75%>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><br/><br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    An interlude: by most popular definitions, <a href=\\\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluegrass_music\\\\\">bluegrass</a> isn&#8217;t folk music.   Where modern singer-songwriter folk teeters on the edge of pop, rock, and blues, with the major exception of crossover artists Crooked Still and Allison Krauss and Union Station, today&#8217;s bluegrass bands find radioplay on the country end of the dial, if at all.    And though there are certainly plenty of crossover alt-country and Americana musicians out there who are welcome at both bluegrass and folk festivals, most music festivals tend to be firmly either/or.   </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>But as I\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve noted previously, folk and bluegrass have much in common.   Both stem from the same early American folk tree; both depend heavily on the acoustic guitar; both use traditional forms of rhyme, verse structure, trope and storytelling in their lyrics and song structure.   <a href=\\\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluegrass_music\\\\\">Wikipedia</a> lists bluegrass as a form of country music, it&#8217;s true, but it also refers to it as a form of American roots music, or Americana \\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x93 the category which encompasses the &#8220;folk&#8221; forms of American music.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>Which is to say: we\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x99re bluegrass fans here at Cover Lay Down.  And though owning up to this has probably already lost me some hardcore folkies over the months since we started, I make no apologies for the bluegrass among the folk.  The acoustic nature of the two forms, and their shared roots in African-American blues, British folk ballads, and appalachian music, makes for a clear commonality, even if the sounds are clearly different.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>One significant distinction between bluegrass and modern folk music is the vastly different ways in which the two forms approach harmony.   Where folk music performance tends to prioritize the singer-songwriter, both as vocalist and instrumentalist, the best bluegrass is about balance \\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x93 between instruments, and among voices.   The bluegrass sound is thus typified by close harmonies that span the range from high male tenor to bass, and a wide range of acoustic stringed instruments \\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x93 typically bass, guitar, banjo, mandolin, and fiddle \\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x93 which echo that vocal range, and, through alternating-beat use of bass and percussive high-stringed chords, provide an equally rich, full sound.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>Bluegrass gets a bad rap in the world of covers &#8212; all those anonymous session musicians cutting albums of Phish and Nine Inch Nails and Led Zeppelin covers just to pay the rent doesn&#8217;t help.   But bluegrass music is much more than country music&#8217;s poor country cousin.    The covers you&#8217;ll find featured in today&#8217;s post are the real deal, performed with love and respect.   Even if you&#8217;re not usually the bluegrass type, I highly recommend giving them a try.<br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <br/><br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <hr width=75%>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><br/><br/><br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <img src=\\\\\"http://bp2.blogger.com/_ndH9tpgnZ7Y/R7jlEJsgfFI/AAAAAAAAAFU/sPGN3DA7UGM/s200/JVLOGO06_Small.jpg\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" title=\\\\\"\\\\\" width=\\\\\"145\\\\\" class=\\\\\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-7130\\\\\" style=\\\\\"margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:8px; margin-right:19px;\\\\\"/>To those unschooled in the history of bluegrass music, the Framingham, MA, Sheraton might seem an especially odd choice for the <a href=\\\\\"http://www.ibma.org/\\\\\">International Bluegrass Music Association</a>&#8216;s 2006 Event of the Year.   But the popular stereotype which casts bluegrass music as a form of southern music belies a rich and long-standing tradition of New England bluegrass.  And remembering that Scots-Irish dance tunes and English ballads are but one of several primary influences on the bluegrass form does help one come to terms with the fact that <a href=\\\\\"http://www.starwoodhotels.com/pub/media/756/NA756EX1_md.jpg\\\\\">the Sheraton is built like a giant Irish castle</a>, and thus looks more like a venue for a jousting tournament than a site for a bluegrass festival.   </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>Once you get over the strange dissonance between the snow-capped castle turrets outside and the sound of a thousand banjos, basses, high tenors and mandolins inside, <a href=\\\\\"http://www.bbu.org/jvhome.htm\\\\\">The Joe Val Bluegrass Festival</a> is a great gig.   Incredibly, festival sponsor the <a href=\\\\\"http://www.bbu.org/index.htm\\\\\">Boston Bluegrass Association</a> manages to successfully reproduce the feel of a great outdoor festival indoors in the dead of winter.  The atmosphere is infectiously fun, from the ubiquitous hallway jam sessions to the ballroom mainstage to the conference rooms stuffed with product demos and instrumental workshops.   </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>And the musical talent is out of this world.   The Joe Val Festival, which celebrates the life of seminal 1960&#8242;s New England bluegrass mandolin player <a href=\\\\\"http://www.answers.com/topic/joe-val?cat=entertainment&#038;nr=1\\\\\">Joe Val</a>, attracts a significant share of IBMA award winners, both old and new.   As such, it&#8217;s a good way to whet one&#8217;s appetite for the cornucopia of summer festivals which pepper New England in the warmer months.   And it&#8217;s a great vehicle for us to consider the place of bluegrass in the spectrum of American folk forms.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>Today, we feature a select set of covers from the artists I\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been lucky enough to see at Joe Val in the past six years.    Together, they explore the surprisingly vast potential of the bluegrass sound, running the gamut from country singer-songwriter to gospel, from old-school to new school.   It was a genuine pleasure to see them all, and it&#8217;s a genuine pleasure to share their work with you.<br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <br/></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <ul>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <li><strong><a href=\\\\\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/donease.mp3\\\\\">Steep Canyon Rangers: Don\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Ease Me In</a> (trad./arr.

His whimsical, ragged takes on songs originally written and performed by Dar Williams, Paul Simon, U2, Joni Mitchell, Elvis Costello, Randy Newman and others have helped illuminate the works of these songwriters, and lent a sense of whimsy to features on Oceanfolk, Winterfolk, Show Tunes covers, and more.  And, in 2009, in order to acknowledge the impending release of Letters From a Flying Machine, <a href=\\\\\"http://coverlaydown.com/2009/07/peter-mulvey-ten-thousand-mornings-redux-covers-of-los-lobos-u2-the-beatles-and-more/\\\\\">we revisited our original post</a>, adding the lone cover from that album &#8211; a delightful take on Ira and George Gershwin&#8217;s <em>Our Love Is Here To Stay</em> &#8211; as justification for our continued celebration.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>As we noted in our first look at the artist, Mulvey\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice falls towards the Tom Waits and Dylan camps, full of feeling but hardly pure; fans tend to cite his songwriting and his guitarplay, which range from spoken word and acoustic swingjazz to contemporary folk and Americana, rather than his strained, whispery, sandpapery voice, when explaining their affection for the Milwaukee-based, Boston-and-Dublin bred singer-songwriter who has produced 16 albums in his career, and toured the country five times by bike.   And certainly, Mulvey and Goodrich celebrate their collaborative fretwork, with the powerful all-instrumental album Nine Days Wonder, released last year, standing as an apt culmination of their partnership.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>But there&#8217;s something to be said for the power of song wrung from a broken instrument, and as a vocalist, Mulvey is a master of making the most of every note.   As a member of Redbird, which also includes Mulvey&#8217;s constant sideman and collaborator David &#8220;Goody&#8221; Goodrich and coffeehouse folkstars (and eventual married couple) Kris Delmhorst and Jeffrey Foucault, he lends a rough edge to harmonies, expanding the sonic experience, grounding the work in emotional grit.  And, as a solo cover artist, whether in his earliest live recordings as a more traditional singer-songwriter or his most recent roots and jazz transformations, the spare voice recasts lyrics powerfully.<br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <br/></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><img src=\\\\\"http://coverlaydown.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/petermulvey1-150x150.jpg\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" title=\\\\\"\\\\\" width=\\\\\"145\\\\\" height=\\\\\"145\\\\\" class=\\\\\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-9702\\\\\" style=\\\\\"margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:8px; margin-right:16px;\\\\\" />At the end of March, Mulvey&#8217;s third major covers-oriented project will come to fruition with the release of <strong>The Good Stuff</strong>, recorded last summer at the Signature Sounds studio just a few miles down the road from where our own blog is based.  The plan was to make a rustic yet living album of standards, with rootsy instrumentation courtesy of Goodrich and others, and a long list of possible songs to winnow down to a single album, based primarily on the songs&#8217; ability to come across as both timeless and lasting.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>And although we&#8217;ve promised not to offer or stream any of the new tracks until early March, having just received our preview copy of the album this week, we&#8217;re thrilled to announce that the project succeeds in spades, due to a potent combination of acoustic genre play, nuanced craftsmanship, and that healthy double-dollop of whimsy and respect which have become the hallmark of Mulvey&#8217;s work.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>As in Ten Thousand Mornings, Mulvey&#8217;s definition of &#8220;standards&#8221; ranges wide indeed, taking us from Duke Ellington to Tom Waits to Jolie Holland in the span of a single album.  But where in that earlier project it was the environment which made for a vibrant, unified experience, with the echoes in the brick and tile underground and the screech and shuss of trains and passersby lending an air of realism, here, even as they mutate and transform to match the sense and sensibility of the set, it is the voice and guitar alone which create cohesion, with each carefully chosen setting providing new insight into a well-chosen classic song.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>The result is practically miraculous: a diverse set, simultaneously ancient and utterly new, which calls us to a myriad of authentic folk and jazz forms, with the music as adept a carrier of the century as the songbook.  His <em>Mood Indigo</em> and <em>High Noon</em> combine bouncy fiddlefolk with a minor key swing, coating a deceptively gentle delivery in dramatic tension; his Thelonious Monk instrumental is just ragged enough; his take on Willie Nelson&#8217;s <em>Are You Sure?</em> is a gleeful acoustic country duet, gentle and wry; his take on Tom Waits&#8217; <em>Green Grass</em> is low and hollow, a death&#8217;s dirge that rises into the night; his cover of Holland&#8217;s <em>Old Fashioned Morphine</em> is a bluesy Waits-esque interpretation, a drink and drug-addled hallucination; his <em>Everybody Knows</em> is a deep, funky samba that wails into electric smoke.   If, as Mulvey notes, these are the songs &#8220;that will be firmly ensconced in the firmament when half a century blows all the rest of the chaff away&#8221;, then there&#8217;s a good chance that his will be the versions which we hear in our heads. </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><em>As noted above, we&#8217;ve been asked not to spill the beans on the newest coverage from Mulvey.   But here&#8217;s a build-up of older coverage from the man himself, both with and without friends &#8211; to reinforce your appreciation for a fine artist and interpreter, and to whet your whistle for the March 28th release of The Good Stuff.  </em><br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <br/></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <ul>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <li><strong><a href=\\\\\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/downby.mp3\\\\\">Peter Mulvey &#038; David Goodrich: Down By The Riverside</a> (trad.)</strong><br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\\\\\"http://www.petermulvey.com/discography.html\\\\\">Nine Days Wonder</a>, 2011)</small></em></li>\\\\n\\\\\\n    </ul>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <ul>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <li><strong><a href=\\\\\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/merm.mp3\\\\\">Peter Mulvey w/ Redbird: Let The Mermaids Flirt With Me</a> (orig.

Today, we present our favorite submissions from three new multi-artist coverage sets, granting us new glimpses into the songbooks of Guy Clark, The Grateful Dead, and Leonard Cohen&#8230;plus a few bonus vids we&#8217;ve had kicking around from another project with a very different focus, indeed. </em><br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <br/><br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    The modern trend towards the slow, track-by-track leak of impending albums as distributed blog-by-blog exclusives intersects with the video cover project conceit in <a href=\\\\\"http://vimeo.com/channels/oldideas\\\\\">Old Ideas With New Friends</a>, designed to raise awareness of <a href=\\\\\"http://www.leonardcohen.com/us/home\\\\\">Old Ideas</a>, Leonard Cohen&#8217;s newest album, among a broad set of younger listeners by connecting his older songbook to the new, predominantly indie inheritors of his dark narrative style.  You gotta admire the conceit of coverage as album promotion &#8211; it worked for Peter Gabriel and Okkervil River, after all &#8211; and though the central genre connection here is broad alternative and hipster indie, not folk, after only five installments, the inevitable crossover has produced some fine versions, with more to come from Old 97s\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Rhett Miller and The New Pornographers\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x99 A.C. Newman, among others.    </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>As a dubious bonus, of sorts, the project&#8217;s use of Vimeo&#8217;s precise sharing and embedding parameters show exactly how artists and labels can regain full control of the viral spread of media content without having to rely on broad-ranging, baby-with-the-bathwater law like SOPA or PIPA.   Which is to say: you really must hear John Darnielle of The Mountain Goat&#8217;s sweet solo piano-driven cover of <em>The Smokey Life</em>, but you&#8217;ll have to head over to either <a href=\\\\\"http://consequenceofsound.net/2012/02/video-the-mountain-goats-cover-leonard-cohens-the-smokey-life-cos-premiere/\\\\\">Consequences of Sound</a> or <a href=\\\\\"http://vimeo.com/channels/oldideas\\\\\">Vimeo</a> to do it, as blog-embedding for the track is currently limited to that one major blog which managed to garner exclusive contract for first release.   Luckily, after a similar short-lived period of exclusivity, the others in the project so far have now been made available to all of us.   Here&#8217;s two that fit our mold.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><br/><br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <strong>Brandford Cox: Seems So Long Ago, Nancy (orig.

The page will be featuring a new fan-made video every day in February, spreading the love&#8230;but in the end, like YouTube writ large, the project&#8217;s corporate underbelly hides a viable way to turn amateur status into gold: five of the videos will be &#8220;chosen&#8221; in March, and their artists&#8217; profiles featured on the Dead&#8217;s online properties, and in the 2012 edition of the Grateful Dead Almanac, thus garnering VIP access to one of the largest music communities standing today.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>Unlike other notables in today&#8217;s set, the Dead Covers project is truly amateur-oriented, with voting pushing fan favorites to the top of the home page; Dead fans being attuned to nuance in performance, the top of the list is quite good indeed, though the average Dead fan&#8217;s willingness to allow ragged recording quality after years of tape trading seems to favor interpretation over sound caliber.   Still, a bit of digging after skimming the top of the list reveals hidden gems that linger, too.   Here&#8217;s five favorites from the newest part of the vault.   </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><br/><br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <strong>Amal Bouhabib &#038; Jeff Malinowski: Cassidy (orig.

But these solo takes from Wic Coleman and Jackson Tanner are equally great in their own way, with a bit more of the dusty troubadour vibe which made Clark so vibrant in concert, for those of us lucky enough to have seen him perform in bare-bones form.   And the full collection bears further note: if you like your folk on the country line, and you&#8217;re willing to accept a few tracks with the drums-and-bass so typical of barroom country among the more delicate, raw works, take a gander at every video over at the project page.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <strong>Jackson Tanner: Queenie&#8217;s Song (orig.

The UU church which we attend is in transition, with an interim minister who has my undying respect; wise, and gentle, with a knack for bringing new texts and ideas to the table, presenting them clearly and coherently, and then braiding them together to reveal the thing which we needed most of the world in that moment.   </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>I experience her sermons as a kind of miracle of the mind, that binds my soul and body, and answers my unspoken need.   Even when I am distracted by my own thoughts, her bright, intelligent prompting provides an avenue for me to come to myself with new eyes, and with a renewed determination to accept that which has been lurking in my heart and mind.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>And in this case, a sermon on blessings and failures, and how we so often fail to allow ourselves to experience the joys and sadness they should bring us, has brought me back to my students.<br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <br/><br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <img src=\\\\\"http://coverlaydown.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/innercity.jpeg\\\\\" alt=\\\\\"\\\\\" title=\\\\\"\\\\\" width=\\\\\"152\\\\\" class=\\\\\"alignleft size-full wp-image-9658\\\\\" style=\\\\\"margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:8px; margin-right:16px;\\\\\" />The students I teach are ill-prepared for success.  They are the product of a city that is stacked against them, a community that is in too much of a hurry to address the deep foundation issues which would support true progress, a system that is under too much pressure to make it look like things are working.  They come to my ninth grade classroom with fifth grade reading skills, without the stamina to be learners for more than a few minutes per class day, with anger against me for enforcing the most basic rules, and an image of the classroom as a competitive space, where they win if they can overwhelm the lesson, or if they can sleep successfully, and thus avoid confronting their unpreparedness.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>They also come, if indeed they come at all &#8211; one in five students is absent on a given day &#8211; with long histories of pitting themselves against the world, which make them almost unteachable for most of the semester, until and if we can delay the curriculum long enough to get into their hearts.  Most of them are incapable of experiencing joy or sadness at all, let alone the empathy we assume is prerequisite for understanding a text.   Instead, they experience only despair and bitterness, disappointment and pride \\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x93 emotions they cannot acknowledge, to themselves or others, lest they appear weak, and lose the only game they know.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>A few of them manage to survive and move forward, and a tiny, tiny percentage aim to thrive.   But these are the minority: just 25% of students in the city where I teach even graduate from high school within four years, and it&#8217;s not hard to see why.   Last week, a boy in one of my classes taunted a girl into attacking him; in the aftermath, his lack of ownership in instigating the fight was both frustrating and expected, but it was his comment that &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a fight; she&#8217;s a girl&#8221; that reminded me just how unprepared these almost-men and almost-women are to accept even the basic conditions that we believe are necessary to help them move forward.   </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>We do what we can for them, and sometimes more than we can afford, in an environment where each student gets just two minutes of my individual attention, if that, per day.  In tiny slices of time we struggle to push our way in, to learn who they are as individuals, to identify the gaps between where they are and where the curriculum assumes they are, and construct a pathway for them that bridges their particular chasm.    </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>But half a bridge is no better than none, and it may be worse, given that it contains so much false hope.   In the end, it is our lot to hold them responsible for their actions, lest we become part of the machine that lies to them, and tells them that they are ready.   It hurts to fail so many, but it would hurt more to pass them along without merit or ability, to undermine their next classes, to perpetuate the lie that a good heart, however buried and patinaed, is evidence of success.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>And so many fail.  Despite unanswered parent phone calls and teacher conferences full of hopelessness, long unattended after school sessions offered, a hundred new attempts at kind words and coaxing, over half of the 80 final grades I will enter into the database before the sun rises tomorrow are F&#8217;s.  Of the remainder, another half are within the D range, marking their recipients as desperately unprepared academically but willing to struggle just enough to produce something that hints of promise, though probability says that not one of these 20-or-so students will pass sufficient classes this year to move on, leaving them stuck in the eternal-seeming limbo that is another ninth grade year.   </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>Only four of my students from last term earned an A of any sort.  Only six earned B&#8217;s.   And of those, there are still one or two who only bothered and blossomed in my class, or perhaps one other &#8211; they liked me, but in a manner untranslatable to other teachers&#8217; style.<br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    <br/><br />\\\\n\\\\\\n    How did we get from sermon to city?   These things are related, somehow, though they are hard to untangle.   But today, in church, as the minister read a section from Everything I Need To Know I Learned In Kindergarten, I was reminded that my students do not know what we taught them then, if indeed we taught them at all.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>And although the time for sharing had passed, suddenly, in the middle of the sermon, I wanted to say a prayer for my students.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>I wanted to light a candle for my beloved failures, curled up against the world so tightly that, like fists, all they can do is destroy.   </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>I wanted to cry, and ask forgiveness; to say that I really did do everything there is to do, and let the feelings simply <i>be</i>, in the community I trust, even as I despair in the peace of my beloved wild things, who tear at me until the bell rings, and the clock runs out, and it is too late. </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>I wanted to, but I didn&#8217;t.  </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>I offer it here, instead. </p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><br/></p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <ul>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <li><strong><a href=\\\\\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/herei.mp3\\\\\">The Diamond Family Archive: Here I Go Again</a> (orig.

And though we still try to balance ourselves between the new and the longstanding &#8211; knowing that introduction of the new and reframing of the familiar better serve us all if grounded in the depths of history, concerned that the temptation to tip into the world of mere promo passalong could trap us yet &#8211; since then, we&#8217;ve returned to the premise numerous times, cautiously optimistic about that which is worth celebrating, determined to ply the first coverage of artist on the cusp as an entry point into their original work and craft.  </p>\\n    <p>By all accounts, the approach works. To take one singular example, just three years after we pulled her live Bob Dylan cover from the mailbag and introduced her to the world atop our very first New Artists, Old Songs feature, <a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/2008/04/new-artists-old-songs-angel-snow-sam-jacobs-and-jon-regen-cover-bob-dylan-tom-petty-and-journey/\">Angel Snow</a> has become both a Nashville sensation and a songwriter to the stars, with three original compositions featured on Alison Krauss&#8217; most recent album. </p>\\n    <p>I note this, though, because in recent weeks, we&#8217;ve started an experiment, sharing our ongoing pursuit of the new and now throughout the week via smaller-scale tidbits on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Cover-Lay-Down/155561104381\">a Cover Lay Down Facebook page</a>; indeed, many of the artists you&#8217;ll hear below have already been tasted there.  And if I was late to the social media networking game, it was for honest reasons: the intention was to expand our coverage and reach, but I worried that such small-scale blasts would obscure and trivialize that which we work so hard to select, share, and celebrate.  </p>\\n    <p>Which is to say: though it confounds the conceit that our New Artist, Old Songs series only features artists not otherwise heard, we&#8217;ll keep the Facebook page going, for the nonce &#8211; it&#8217;s fun, and the fact that it has served as fodder and anticipator for this very feature suggests that it is working, even if only 150 of you have &#8220;liked&#8221; the page thus far.  But we&#8217;re also using today&#8217;s entry to make a commitment to the continued need to feature the emerging artist at his or her inception.  Because the slow population climb over in the breakneck zone of social media has revealed an important truth: blogging is not dead.  Micro-media are fickle; it takes more than 140 characters to tout and truly celebrate, to expand and explain.  And where those who blog the popular too often aim merely to pass along today&#8217;s hot potato, our goal is not to crest the wave, but to support at the foundation.   </p>\\n    <p>And so, today, we bring forth an expanded set of shorties, pulled from recent Facebook posts, blogs, mailbag, and beyond.  Because, as the slow but steady success of Angel Snow and so many others have shown us, the longevity and permanence that a blog can bring matter greatly, in the end.   And while words in the blue-and-white slipstream fade fast from our consciousness, the depth and commitment we offer here on these virtual pages is where our heart lies.  </i></p>\\n    <p><br/><br />\\n    <img src=\"http://coverlaydown.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/jc-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-9606\" style=\"margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:8px; margin-right:16px;\" />It&#8217;s hard to avoid the inevitable comparisons to Sandy Denny and June Tabor when talking about new UK folk revivalist <a href=\"http://www.josienneclarke.co.uk/\">Josienne Clarke</a>.  But all British accent and penchant for tradfolk tropes aside, there&#8217;s something stunningly modern in the crystal-clear production she trends towards, and utterly ancient in the delicate stringwork she favors as accompaniment to her sweet, achingly controlled soprano vocals and recorders.  The result is a perfect balance of both classical voice-and-guitar folk and traditional balladry, in many ways more reminiscent of John Renbourne&#8217;s quieter, more pensive work than anything.  And the music is everything we might want in a folk album: delicate, crisp, subtle and nuanced, and beautiful in every tiny moment, from each full-throated opening note to a thousand lingering fades and falls.</p>\\n    <p>For all that, Clarke has released but two formal albums: 2010 debut <a href=\"http://josienneclarke.bandcamp.com/album/one-light-is-gone\">One Light Is Gone</a>, and <a href=\"http://josienneclarke.bandcamp.com/album/the-seas-are-deep\">The Seas Are Deep</a>, a &#8220;pay what you want&#8221; Bandcamp collection of well-loved folk songs recorded by and with multi-instrumentalist Ben Walker, and featuring apt assistance from Red Clay Halo cellist Jo Silverston on four of the nine album tracks.  Walker&#8217;s production and mixing are exquisite; their take on <em>Silver Dagger</em>, especially, has been making the rounds of the folkblogs, even going so far as to bring <a href=\"http://www.songsillinois.net/2012/01/josienne-clarkes-gorgeous-take-on-silver-dagger/\">songs:illinois</a> out of semi-hiatus in mid-January.   For comparison&#8217;s sake, check out mastered versions of <em>John Riley</em> and <em>Black Is The Color</em> below, fully sprung from the brand new collaboration, and then stick around for Josienne&#8217;s covers of Nick Drake, Jackson C. Frank, and Richard Thompson.  </p>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/johnr.mp3\">Josienne Clarke &#038; Ben Walker: John Reilly</a> (trad.)</li>\\n    <li><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/blackis.mp3\">Josienne Clarke &#038; Ben Walker: Black Is The Color</a> (trad.)</strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.josienneclarke.co.uk/\">The Seas Are Deep</a>, 2011)</small></em></li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/dim.mp3\">Josienne Clarke: The Dimming Of The Day</a> (orig.

The resultant tracks are mystical and freeing, hypnotic and haunting, challenging our preconceptions while thrilling the senses; as with other covers but moreso, they also lead us to Paul&#8217;s substantive set of original works, which tender the same tenor and tropes, ridding us of our preconceptions about what folk is and should be, even as they echo of the modern indiefolk and neo-trad movements.

Hecht&#8217;s more recent originals run from truly tender ballads to full-bore Americana folk &#8211; his original lost-love song <em>A Reckoning Of Us</em> is absolutely amazing, and should be played for anyone who thinks they&#8217;ve heard it all before &#8211;  but his early YouTube covers are honest and warm, delightful and potent, the singer-songwriter&#8217;s heart and confidence showing through in what is ordinarily an amateur&#8217;s medium, despite low-tech, late-night videography and recording quality; as I noted on Facebook, his soft coverage of Patrick Swayze&#8217;s one and only hit single from the Dirty Dancing soundtrack is surely the best take on the song ever, bar none, even if the recording quality is ragged and a bit too low.   And Brumel and Elizabeth&#8217;s <em>Falling Slowly</em> cover truly showcases their voices without drowning them, the low guitar more than just strumming, but carrying the undertow weight of the song, proving the worth of both their collaboration, and of the individual talents involved.  Keep an eye on both artists for more as their careers continue to grow.  </p>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/imon.mp3\">Robby Hecht: I&#8217;m On Fire</a> (orig.

His coverage tells us what his influences are, really &#8211; two decent albeit formulaic Iron &#038; Wine songs, a beautiful version of fingerpicking instrumental master Andy McKee&#8217;s <em>For My Father</em>, a warbly take on Angus and Julia Stone&#8217;s <em>The Devil&#8217;s Tears</em>, and this wonderful Bon Iver cover &#8211; but it&#8217;s his pinched, deliberately strained rock and roll tenor, reminiscent of Green Day lead singer Billy Joe Armstrong more than anything, that so startles me, especially when coupled with ringing guitar, lush bedroom production elements, and what appears to be overdubbed harmonies.   </p>\\n    <p>It took me forever to figure out that I had actually heard of Stagg before this &#8211; he&#8217;s the Bristol student whose YouTube Deer Tick cover so struck the band, they invited him on stage at the End Of The Road festival in 2010 to play along with them.  But beyond that single anecdote, as with other artists we&#8217;ve featured in the past in our New Artists series, there&#8217;s very little else about Stagg himself out there &#8211; a google search reveals no such artist, the SoundCloud page itself contains nary a link; it&#8217;s possible that he&#8217;s now performing as part of a grungy pop trio calling themselves <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/OfficialSilverWings\">Silver Wings</a>, but it&#8217;s hard to tell.   For now, at least, the music will have to speak for itself.  </p>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/bbank.mp3\">Duncan Stagg: Blood Bank</a> (orig.

And so I repeat myself, by noting again that turn-around time on coverage these days is pretty fast; youth finds its way forwards faster, too.   Here, with evidence of how the cycle works, is brand new 17-year old Swedish folk sensation <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/Adna0\">Adna</a>, newly signed to Despotz Records and just about to release her first single via YouTube sometime this week, who found enough time in the studio during that same session to cover one of the newest singles from equally young, equally scandinavian First Ait Kit, who made their own initial splash with a cover of Fleet Foxes on YouTube in 2008, and are now wowing the blogs with their own major label album.<br />\\n    <br/></p>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong>Adna: The Lion&#8217;s Roar (orig.

The talent&#8217;s there in spades, but timing is still everything, guys &#8211; so here&#8217;s hoping a little extra luck keeps the momentum going.

When he awoke, he wrote the song down, changing but one line in transcription, and the rest, as they say, is history.   </p>\\n    <p>Of course, Townes did indeed become famous, though partially posthumously, and surely not on the same scale as he envisioned in his nocturnal emissions.   But as I&#8217;ve noted several times in these virtual pages, I discovered the work of the haunted cowboy troubadour late in life.   As such, though it has been around for decades, this well-covered classic came to me first as a gift from Boston-based singer-songwriter Meg Hutchinson, who brought it to our 2009 house concert, in graceful recognition that her host was a coverfan and coverblogger.   </p>\\n    <p>Since then, the song has haunted me.   Its apparitions include a recent live (albeit sadly unrecorded) house concert performance by Connecticut State Troubadour Chuck E. Costa&#8217;s newest duo project The Sea The Sea that folded the song into one of Costa&#8217;s originals, a found take from an Antje Duvekot live album featuring 2011 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival Emerging Artist Showcase winner Chris O&#8217;Brien, several amazing studio versions from the likes of Carrie Rodriguez &#038; Ben Kyle, Jennifer Parker, and others, and a video from a Robby Hecht and Liz Longley concert posted on YouTube just this month.   And, taken together, these visitations remind me of why we bring multiple takes on the same song to the table, in our ongoing mission to understand just how much diverse beauty can be wrung from simple lyrics and melody.<br />\\n    <br/><br />\\n    <img src=\"http://coverlaydown.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/emmylou_harris_don_williams-if_i_needed_you_s-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"142\" height=\"142\" class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-9581\" style=\"margin-top:4px; margin-bottom:8px; margin-right:16px;\" />That the versions I have encountered include both duets and solo takes is both atypical of coverage writ large and, in this case, unsurprising.   For much like in the case of <a href=\"http://coverlaydown.blogspot.com/2008/03/single-song-sunday-leonard-cohens.html\">Leonard Cohen&#8217;s <em>Hallelujah</em></a>, which was comprehensively and permanently redefined by Jeff Buckley, a definitive cover early in the song&#8217;s history has created two divergent paths of versioning, bifurcating our resultant coverage collection into two primary camps: those that cover the rough, solo Townes original, and those that take on the sweet harmonies which Don Williams and Emmylou Harris brought to their definitive 1981 Country duet.  </p>\\n    <p>Especially interesting is the effect that this split path has on the song&#8217;s meaning.  For while the lyrics and melody &#8211; three simple chords, eminently singable &#8211; speak to a simple message of love asked for and gratefully given, in the original form, so long as we accept &#8220;the lady&#8221; of the penultimate verse as a sort of embodiment of love itself, and the second verse as a bedroom metaphor for how deeply and closely this love can manifest, there is room for the audience to see themselves as the subject of the song, the &#8220;other&#8221; to the narrator&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8221;.   </p>\\n    <p>The duet form of the song changes this.   Where the solo take is universal, the duet clarifies and personifies the object, turning the love into something both more intimate and less inclusive, making it harder to broaden the message to the listening group, closing the gap between singers even as it closes us off from direct address.    Gone is the plaintive, confessional ache, given freely and universally, projected outward, which typifies versions from solo singer-songwriters such as Hutchinson, country crooner Lyle Lovett, Georgia-based fiddler Jennifer Parker, ambient Vancouver-based folk artist Lance Odegard, surprisingly adept Britfolk artist Christina Kulukundis, clear-voiced UK acoustic blues picker Dave Sutherland, Townes contemporary Guy Clark, and others, even as they make the song their own.   Instead, we find Robby Hecht and Jill Andrews turning into each other from the start, Carrie Rodriguez and Ben Kyle trading lush emotion, Alex Brumel and Janel Elizabeth warm and contemporary, Duvekot and O&#8217;Brien hushed and sparse in their duality.  </p>\\n    <p>And so the delivery becomes the key to this song&#8217;s meaning, in the end.   And while full-band efforts, instrumentals, or full-blown genre transformations can transcend this duality &#8211; see, for example, the folk rock whisper of Dashboard Confessional&#8217;s three-part Americana, the bluegrass twang and borrowed Harris/Williams vocal trade-offs of Kasey Chambers family project The Dead Ringer Band, Enzo Garcia&#8217;s gentle banjo instrumental, Doc and Merle Watson&#8217;s madcap vinyl fingerpick, and the multiple vocal and instrumental layers down-home country stringband Swiftwater brings to their own rich take &#8211; only Swedish singer-songwriter Christian Kjellvander, by pulling the female harmonies far, far back, manages to straddle the two most typical forms of the song. </p>\\n    <p>But put the versions together, and the breadth of our need, and its manifestations, become clear.   Everybody hurts, sometimes; whether through invitation, participant-observation, or direct address, folk songs such as this speak to our heart&#8217;s ache, and calm us by channeling the storms of emotion that unite us in humanity.   May the song serve, in every incidence, as balm and confirmation: that it is more than merely enough to ask, to stand, to give solace and shared sunrise, to receive it in turn.  Indeed, it is all we have, and all we need.<br />\\n    <br/></p>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/iinymh.mp3\">Meg Hutchinson: If I Needed You</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(live from Passim, 2008)</small></em></li>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/iinylo.mp3\">Lance Odegard: If I Needed You</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://lanceodegard.bandcamp.com/album/here\">Here</a>, 2008)</small></em></li>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/iinyck2.mp3\">Christina Kulukundis: If I Needed You</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.forthesakeofthesong.co.uk/introducingtvz.html\">Introducing Townes Van Zandt via The Great Unknown</a>, 2009)</small></em></li>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/iinyll.mp3\">Lyle Lovett: If I Needed You</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.lylelovett.com/#/music/\">Step Inside This House</a>, 1998)</small></em></li>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/iinyds.mp3\">Dave Sutherland: If I Needed You</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.redkiterecords.co.uk/redkiterecordsdb.html\">On The Waiting List</a>, 2008)</small></em></li>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/iinygc.mp3\">Guy Clark: If I Needed You</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.guyclark.com/music.html#somedays\">Somedays The Song Writes You</a>, 2009)</small></em></li>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/iinyjp.mp3\">Jennifer Parker: If I Needed You</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTzt_2gH438\">YouTube</a>, 2010)</small></em></li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/iinyeh.mp3\">Emmylou Harris &#038;

Known for his pithy, sardonic wit in song and social commentary &#8211; <i>enjoy every sandwich</i>, his oft-quoted insight on dying which would later become the title for the first of two posthumous tribute albums, is a terse encapsulation of that observational mastery which shines through his back catalog &#8211; the man who released just twelve studio albums in 35 years was nonetheless a respected mainstay of the rock circuit, celebrated by his peers and critics alike, even though all but two of those albums never rose above the top 20 in Billboard sales charts.  </p>\\n    <p>Like many artists who poured their body and soul into the industry, Zevon had his demons.  The measured success of 1978 album Excitable Boy was followed by a descent into drug abuse and alcoholism, several failed relationships, and, eventually, the loss of his major label support after his ability to produce more hits turned out to be unreliable.   The resultant stripped-back sound he brought on tour through much of the nineties was as much a function of his inability to pay for a full band as it was an attempt to strip bare the songs he had written.  His posthumous Grammys were merited, for sure: The Wind is a potent album, and a contemporary folk gem.   But it&#8217;s hard to argue that his path was clear, or his talent always evident, in every note, or indeed every album.  </p>\\n    <p>Still, Zevon was a storyteller of the first order, and stories told well make for powerful folk narrative: <em>Roland The Headless Thompson Gunner</em>, for example, is a murder ballad plain and simple, modern in language but timeless in melody and sentiment, and Naomi Bedford&#8217;s recent version of the song evokes its traditional structure and trope quite well; <em>Mohammed&#8217;s Radio</em> is political but childlike in its observations, as cryptic and direct as a Dylan opus, and The Matthew Show&#8217;s slow folk rock is apt.   His work in collaboration with Jackson Browne, who co-wrote Shawn Colvin hit cover <em>Tenderness On The Block</em>, is legendary and worthy of its acclaim.   And his existential pop hit <em>Werewolves of London</em>, though more often covered as a sort of gleefully crashing bar band encore &#8211; and here given the live polka treatment by The Garbonzos &#8211; is actually quite a potent commentary on the trappings of fame and fortune.  </p>\\n    <p>Sure, most of the coverage one can find comes from the same two or three albums which represented the peak of his career, even if it comes in diverse measures, from the avant electro-folk echoes of Ivory Library to Counting Crows frontman Adam Duritz&#8217; country ballad <em>Carmelita</em>, from Freddie White coming on like the Irish Greg Brown in a low, mellow take on <em>Accidentally Like A Martyr</em> to the oddly gentle slide guitar occasional Zevon co-conspirator David Lindley brings to violent oddity <em>Play It All Night Long</em>.    But it&#8217;s his late-career singles, the tender, wistful <em>Don&#8217;t Let Us Get Sick</em> and the sparse couplets and plaintive repeated refrain of <em>Keep Me In Your Heart For A While</em>, written when he was already dying of cancer, that catch in my heart.  It takes a true adept to look death in the face and head into the studio.   That such tenderness resulted is a stunning testament to Warren Zevon&#8217;s life and craft.</p>\\n    <p><br/></p>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/roland.mp3\">Naomi Bedford: Roland The Headless Thompson Gunner</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.naomibedford.co.uk/\">Tales from the Weeping Willow</a>, 2011)</small></em></li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/accid.mp3\">Freddie White: Accidentally Like A Martyr</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.freddiewhite.com/fourdaysinmay.htm\">Four Days In May</a>, 2004)</small></em></li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/moham.mp3\">The Matthew Show: Mohammed&#8217;s Radio</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Hurry-Home-Early-Songs-Warren/dp/B0009WJ2RG\">Hurry Home Early: The Songs of Warren Zevon</a>, 2005)</small></em></li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/dontlet.mp3\">Jill Sobule: Don&#8217;t Let Us Get Sick</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Enjoy-Every-Sandwich-Songs-Warren/dp/B0002XED9E\">Enjoy Every Sandwich: The Songs of Warren Zevon</a>, 2004)</small></em></li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/excit.mp3\">Ivory Library: Excitable Boy</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/ivorylibrary2\">Aleatory Music</a>, 1987)</small></em></li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/carmel.mp3\">Adam Duritz: Carmelita</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/I-10-Chronicles/dp/B00004S37U\">The I-10 Chronicles</a>, 2000)</small></em></li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/keepme.mp3\">Gale Mead: Keep Me In Your Heart</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.galemead.com/music.html\">Common Good</a>, 2008)</small></em></li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/werew.mp3\">The Garbonzos: Werewolves Of London</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/Garbonzos1\">The Garbonzos at the Venice Cafe</a>, 2010)</small></em></li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/tender.mp3\">Shawn Colvin: Tenderness On The Block</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.shawncolvin.com/fatCity.html\">Fat City</a>, 1992)</small></em></li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <ul>\\n    <li><strong><a href=\"http://coverlaydown.com/tunes/2012/playit.mp3\">David Lindley &#038; Hani Naser: Play It All Night Long</a></strong><br />\\n    <em><small>(from <a href=\"http://www.davidlindley.com/cgi-bin/dlshop.cgi\">Live In Tokyo</a>, 1994)</small></em></li>\\n    </ul>\\n    <p><br/></p>\\n    \\n    <p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/pX8kpBdOIDXKZb_SpeLsW4buQJk/0/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/pX8kpBdOIDXKZb_SpeLsW4buQJk/0/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a><br/>\\n    <a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/pX8kpBdOIDXKZb_SpeLsW4buQJk/1/da\"><img src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/pX8kpBdOIDXKZb_SpeLsW4buQJk/1/di\" border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\"></img></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\\n    <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CoverLayDown?a=-zGRigjtkRU:4pJuuEd4-FU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CoverLayDown?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CoverLayDown?a=-zGRigjtkRU:4pJuuEd4-FU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CoverLayDown?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CoverLayDown?a=-zGRigjtkRU:4pJuuEd4-FU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CoverLayDown?i=-zGRigjtkRU:4pJuuEd4-FU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CoverLayDown?a=-zGRigjtkRU:4pJuuEd4-FU:DLYy-l-dIDg\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CoverLayDown?d=DLYy-l-dIDg\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\\n    </div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CoverLayDown/~4/-zGRigjtkRU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\\n  entry_id: http://coverlaydown.com/?p=9551\\n  published: 2012-01-25 00:00:57 Z\\n  summary: Happy Birthday to Warren Zevon, whose graveled voice I never truly appreciated until his final album was released just before his death in 2003.

Their harmony work on Nikki&#8217;s recent solo release Driftwood is stunning, highly recommended for those willing to take a chance on some serious CMT-caliber county and 70&#8242;s era rock.  And their recent EP <a href=\"http://www.timandnickibluhm.com/\">Duets</a>, which came out towards the end of 2011, is Americana pure and simple, clear as a bell, sparse and tender with just voices and guitar, easily able to hold a candle to the work of Graham and Emmylou, Carter and Cash, Joni and James, and other singing country couples that came before them.

Because last week, a fan sent me the Fleetwood Mac cover from Moray&#8217;s brand new album Skulk, and I was smitten immediately by the juxtaposition of epic echoes and driving banjo, and the beautiful, unresolved tension these two bare elements create.  It was tough to round up details with Wikipedia down, but from what I could tell, the thirty-something British folk singer is a big name across the pond, well respected by his peers and his homeland critics, who has won major awards and placed high on the UK folk festival circuit for his prolific output and prodigious sound over the past decade.  And for moment there, I began to wonder why I hadn&#8217;t heard his work before.</p>\\n    <p>That the name didn&#8217;t really ring a bell is likely both a comment on how challenging it is for British folk musicians to break into the American soundscape, where the word folk isn&#8217;t always applied to the heavier, more produced sound that Moray sometimes favors in his other role as a producer for both his own work and for bands such as Oysterband.  But it also likely a function of Moray&#8217;s own musical journey in his single decade as a recording artist, one typified by an almost impatient willingness to experiment with various sounds from one record to the next, from the electronic soundscapes of his early work to his self-titled mid-millennial orchestral album to more recent explorations of world music instrumentation and &#8211; oddly &#8211; a folk/dubstep collaboration as grimy as it sounds.  </p>\\n    <p>Once I made the connection between the name and his earlier sonic incarnations, of course, it turned out I had a couple of bonus tracks lurking in the archives: an XTC cover which reminds us strongly of the modern neotrad British folkscene lightly hybridized with indiepop and a New Orleans Jazz coda, a haunting trad-to-electrofolk mashup of <em>Early One Morning</em> from his bedroom-recorded 2003 full-length debut, and an oddly ragged barrelhouse cover of <em>Drive My Car</em> that I dug up on Rubber Folk, a 2005 British Beatles tribute that has never failed to please.   Taking them as a set shows just how much this new track, with its crystal clear production and hollow, sparse-yet-frenetic soundscape, represents a new direction for Moray, a still-evolving musician who &#8211; while well-known in his native England &#8211; deserves as much international attention as we can spark, and then some.   </p>\\n    <p>But Skulk is also a dozen albums in one: utterly, sprawlingly gorgeous, with softer folk ballads in aching voice, pop sensibility in sunnier sultry cuts, and jazz elements in hidden corners &#8211; Kate Rusby and Sandy Denny in one turn, Nickel Creek in another, Imogen Heap and James Blunt in the next.

Nurses held their own with the heavy reverb and falsetto vocals that managed to overcome the less than stellar sound at the Fox Theatre. The material relied heavily on the mind warping release of &#8220;Dracula&#8221; that hit it&#8217;s high pitch with &#8220;Fever Dream.&#8221; I still have that beat stuck in my head and my feet won&#8217;t stop tapping along. </p>\\n    <p>It&#8217;s safe to say that I&#8217;ve caught almost every Malkmus performance withing a 700 mile radius. I don&#8217;t remember the Jicks relying so heavily on the extended jams. I started having flashbacks of Trey, Paige, Mike and Jon going on an extended twenty minute &#8220;Tweezer&#8221; teaser when the show ended last night with &#8220;1% of One.&#8221; Not as much stage banter as recent shows, however, the new drummer, Jake Morris (the Joggers) did a serviceable job filling in for the departed and very talented Janet Weiss who is drumming with Wild Flag. &#8220;Brain Gallop&#8221; blindsided me with how much fun the four were having on stage and it showed with the improvisation from multi-instrumentalist, Mike Clark. It was nice to hear classics like &#8220;Church on White&#8221; and the very apropos, &#8220;Jenny and the Ess Dog,&#8221; you know, being in Boulder and all. On the way out, it dawned on me that the Jicks have been together longer than Pavement. Crazy. In case you ever wanted to hear the Jicks cover La Guns, now&#8217;s your chance. Head over <a href=\"http://www.makinwhoopee.ca/2012/02/mitchmatic-its-probably-raining-why.html\">here</a> and listen at the 1:48:10.

The Texas ties are running deep and the sound of the pedal steel last night spun the typical bar sound that Finn usually evokes with his day job, the Hold Steady. His normal Ginsberg fashion of talking versus singing found a happy medium last night when the story would segway into the song and towards the bridge, he would start exercising his voice a little more. Not fully singing, but I&#8217;m ok with that. For those locals that have been to a sold out Larimer show, you would know that the first couple of songs are crowded in the stage area and typically clears out by the third or fourth song filling the bar area. Last night, the bar stayed empty and Finn captivated everybody with his anecdotes of Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise movies or leaving the big city with your tale between your legs. The solo effort has plenty of &#8220;Jesus&#8221; references, and the visit down to Texas could&#8217;ve served as a cathartic experience. I never liked the Hold Steady, but it might be time to visit &#8220;Separation Sunday.&#8221;</p>\\n    <p><a href=\"http://causeequalstime.com/musique/05%20Jackson.mp3\">Craig Finn-Jackson [mp3]</a></p>\\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/julioenriquez/6877171457/\" title=\"Craig Finn ::: Larimer Lounge ::: 02.13.12 by Julio Enriquez, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7043/6877171457_b24cc119ac_b.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"408\" alt=\"Craig Finn ::: Larimer Lounge ::: 02.13.12\"></a></p>\\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/julioenriquez/6877168999/\" title=\"Craig Finn ::: Larimer Lounge ::: 02.13.12 by Julio Enriquez, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7200/6877168999_7801036c85_b.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"408\" alt=\"Craig Finn ::: Larimer Lounge ::: 02.13.12\"></a></p>\\n    <p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/julioenriquez/6877173647/\" title=\"Craig Finn ::: Larimer Lounge ::: 02.13.12 by Julio Enriquez, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7200/6877173647_bc7c6356f9_b.jpg\" width=\"612\" height=\"917\" alt=\"Craig Finn ::: Larimer Lounge ::: 02.13.12\"></a></p>\\n\\n  entry_id: http://causeequalstime.com/?p=13396\\n  published: 2012-02-14 22:02:20 Z\\n  summary: It&#8217;s important to point out that me seeing Craig Finn was very last minute.

While Drake and Rick Ross prepare their own version (You Only Live Once), Lysick took his own stance at the acronym. From the experience of others and his own, he quickly made a statement that fits the acronym, and realized that many only love once. Originally scheduled to be a mixtape, the free album draws inspiration from the lyricist\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x98s past relationships or simply from the topic of love itself. Don\\\\xE2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let the title fool you, there is nothing cheesy about this body of work; Many will be surprised or shocked at the outcome and the twist the album takes. It is not an ordinary, common, or regular journey through love. What could it be? Only one way to find out. Lysick&#8217;s YOLO (You Only Love Once) is now out, Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p></blockquote>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><a href=\\\\\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Lysick/162385090493560?sk=app_204974879526524\\\\\" target=\\\\\"_blank\\\\\">Like</a> Lysick on Facebook and <a href=\\\\\"https://twitter.com/#!/Lysick_Wasiu\\\\\" target=\\\\\"_blank\\\\\">Follow</a> Lysick on Twitter.</p>\\\\n\"\\n  entry_id: http://yesgoodmusic.com/?p=9920\\n  published: 2012-02-18 20:30:50 Z\\n  summary: \"Although I don&#8217;t love that YOLO phrase, Lysick&#8217;s debut project, YOLO is definitely\\\\xC2\\\\xA0worth\\\\xC2\\\\xA0checking out. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0Watch the video for the title track from his free album\\\\xC2\\\\xA0above.

of a band covering Jimmy Eat World&#8217;s <em><a href=\\\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR3oa2r5qtE&amp;feature=player_embedded\\\\\">The Middle</a></em> landed in my inbox a month or so ago, the first thing that struck me was that it was really, really slick. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0It purported to be a &#8216;live&#8217; session, but the production values for both the sound and the visuals were far above what one normally expects from a hitherto unknown band (Brooklyn-based indie-folk outfit <a href=\\\\\"http://www.facebook.com/TownHallBand\\\\\">Town Hall </a>may have released their debut,\\\\xC2\\\\xA0<em>Tour EP</em>, at least a year ago, but I&#8217;d certainly never heard of them before). \\\\xC2\\\\xA0The impressive video &#8211; and it&#8217;s equally impressive collection of microphones and instruments &#8211; makes more sense upon learning that the\\\\xC2\\\\xA0<em>Tour EP</em> made its way into the hands of the prodigiously talented (or at the very least prodigiously dedicated) people at <a href=\\\\\"http://www.masonjarmusic.com/\\\\\">Mason Jar Music</a>.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>This self-styled collective of creative types specialize in both video work and sound production, with instrumental arrangement being their speciality. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0They&#8217;ve teamed up with Town Hall to re-record and re-release their EP, which is\\\\xC2\\\\xA0now called\\\\xC2\\\\xA0<em><a href=\\\\\"http://townhall.bandcamp.com/\\\\\">Sticky Notes &amp; Paper Scraps</a></em> and boasts the work of a deft and accomplished sonic touch. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0I&#8217;m often disparaging of bands using covers to help break themselves into the mainstream, but perhaps I ought to re-evaluate my stance; in this instance the cover served as an effective gateway drug into a band with a genuinely beautiful aesthetic and some cracking songs to match it.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <object

/>\\\\n\\\\\\n    Geographically speaking, I don&#8217;t think I could be further from Scotland and still be in the UK. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0You&#8217;d never guess that from reading this blog however, as Scottish acts seem to be dominating my tastes for the last few years. \\\\xC2\\\\xA02011 has been no exception, and four albums on this list have their roots firmly planted north of the borders. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0As well as being a year for\\\\xC2\\\\xA0Scots, 2011 appears to be the year of the Return To Form. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0In itself this is a good thing, as recent years have seen more\\\\xC2\\\\xA0disappointing\\\\xC2\\\\xA0highly-hyped albums than good ones, but it means there&#8217;s a higher than normal percentage of &#8216;old pros&#8217; in this year&#8217;s list: amazingly, only one album on this list is a debut.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>At this point an\\\\xC2\\\\xA0honourable\\\\xC2\\\\xA0mention ought to go Chris Thile and Michael Daves\\\\xC2\\\\xA0for their album <em>Sleep With One Eye Open</em>. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0The Hype Machine&#8217;s widget for compiling their annual Zietgeist list didn&#8217;t recognize the Jonnie Common record, so albums 9 and 10 got bumped up a place, meaning Thile and Daves were promoted to the number ten spot on my Hype Machine list, but didn&#8217;t make the top ten proper.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>So without further ado, here is the moment you&#8217;ve all been waiting for since January; the official Eaten by Monsters blog Top Ten of 2010:</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p><a

/></a>10.\\\\xC2\\\\xA0<strong><em>Making Mirrors</em>\\\\xC2\\\\xA0by Gotye.</strong>\\\\xC2\\\\xA0I umm-ed and ah-ed about whether this one would make the cut or not, as it isn&#8217;t a perfect record by any standards, and at times it strays far from what I would normally consider to be tasteful. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0For all it&#8217;s\\\\xC2\\\\xA0occasional\\\\xC2\\\\xA0flaws however, when it&#8217;s good it&#8217;s very, very good. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0His duet with Kimbra on<em>\\\\xC2\\\\xA0Somebody That I Used To Know</em> is a particular highlight, and the album is worth owning purely on

even greater success. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0An assured and overwhelmingly impressive album, <em>New Blood</em>\\\\xC2\\\\xA0is a truly remarkable feat, especially coming from someone that I&#8217;d written

<p>Well we&#8217;ve finally made it to the end, and it turns out these little single-song showcase posts have been quite popular; I&#8217;ll have to do it again sometime. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0Since Christmas is practically upon us now, I thought I&#8217;d better post what I consider to be the best Christmas song ever. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0In fact, this little number from <a href=\\\\\"http://theveryfoundation.com/\\\\\">The Very Foundation</a>\\\\xC2\\\\xA0(courtesy of <a href=\\\\\"http://www.xopublicity.com/xofortheholidays4.html\\\\\">XO for the Holidays</a> 2009 comp.) is a song that ought to be an all-time-top-song of mine, but it&#8217;s just so Christmasy that to listen to it outside of December would just feel wrong. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0As it is, I savour the short time that I can get away with playing it on almost constant repeat. \\\\xC2\\\\xA0Witty and at times ridiculous, yet always displaying a proper Christmas spirit (without ever descending into schmaltz), this is, in my view, the very best that Christmas music has to offer.</p>\\\\n\\\\\\n    <p>I hope all your day&#8217;s are merry and bright, and merry Christmas to all, and to all a good

The beautiful thing about music in today’s age is that technology has created an infinite supply of great music that is available to us at the click of a mouse. How perfect is that? We can discover a brand new artist on the opposite side of the globe in seconds without a radio or a music television channel. It only makes sense that a website so dedicated to this gorgeous universe of music would want to celebrate the greatness and share it with anyone who is looking.</p>\\n<p>My name is Eric (Connecticutter), and I am your host of <strong>Straight from the Teet</strong>, where I will delve into 7 new albums per week and let you know which tracks I loved from the albums I listened to.

I, like a majority of the male population, don't have much interest in the holiday and obviously did not think about it when I decided which albums I would be listening to this week. Out of the seven albums for this week's list, 5 of them carried depressing themes and ideas that dealt with loneliness and despair, perfect for the holiday that celebrates true, undistinguished love. <strong>This Winter Room</strong>, also known by his birth name Chip Johnson, released one of those albums in late January. The album, <em>Losing The Paper Moon</em>, has been a very quiet release. I actually came across it by complete mistake and was quite surprised by the beauty it carried. Johnson isn't an incredible vocalist or guitarist but he somehow is able to connect with his listeners very personally. I have always been a sucker for dream pop vocals where the singer normally sings under their breathe while the instruments overlay the lyrics. Johnson uses this technique quite a bit where the chords played on guitar are a bit louder then his voice as he almost whispers his song lyrics. I like the idea of that on the album which is mostly depressing as it recognizes his lonesomeness. He longs to be held by someone and be in love again and even though his spirits are kept high, he just can't seem to find that one, true companion he is longing for. As a whole, this album was actually a very worthwhile listen, especially if you are into indie folk-rock music. It's kind of a blend of <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipr7VIJlZeQ\" target=\"_blank\">Melanoid</a> </strong>and <strong><a href=\"http://roguevalley.bandcamp.com/album/false-floors\" target=\"_blank\">Rogue Valley</a> </strong>with a little bit of extra folk ingredients stirred in. For the most part, the standout tracks overshadow the rest of the album as songs such as \"Half Awake (Half Asleep)\" and \"Foreign And Freezing\" just tell such passionate stories where we're really put onto the tracks with an oncoming train of sadness coming directly at us.</p>\\n<p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n              <a href=\"#stream\" class=\"player-link stream\" title=\"Stream\">\\n        Stream<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n                    <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link76163-0\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-0');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title76163-0\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-0');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">This Winter Room</span> - Half Awake (Half Asleep) <span class='time'>(04:21)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div><p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n          <a href=\"http://files2.earmilk.com/tracks/MjAxMi0wMi8xMSAtIEZvcmVpZ24gYW5kIEZyZWV6aW5nLm1wMw==.mp3\" class=\"player-link download\" title=\"Download\">\\n        Download<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n                        <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link76163-1\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-1');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title76163-1\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-1');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">This Winter Room</span> - Foreign And Freezing <span class='time'>(03:24)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div><hr />\\n<h2>Islands - <em>A Sleep &amp; A Forgetting</em>:</h2>\\n<p><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-76409\" title=\"Islands - A Sleep and A Forgetting\" src=\"http://www.earmilk.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Islands-A-Sleep-and-A-Forgetting-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" />Alright, so it's Valentine's Day. The day of hearts and cupids. The day where giving out chocolates as though they were multiplying micro-organisms isn't considered a health risk and giving out roses is considered a normality. This over-dramatized \"day of love\" holds it's significance for all the couples around the world whose relationships are as cinematic as \"When Harry Met Sally\" or \"Casablanca\". But lets be honest, who really has relationships like these? In today's day and age, the idea of love has become just a constant fixation rather then a miracle between two, alluring souls. Love is a forever changed word when you think about it. I know it scares the shit out of me to the point where even the thought of using it has brought on total anxiety. Yeah sure, I might be fucked up but what about Nicholas Thorburn? It seems his feelings on the concepts and pains of the idea of love stick with him more then the good natured enjoyment of the idea. This is exactly what stands out in his lyrics for his new album with <strong>Islands</strong>, <em>A Sleep &amp; A Forgetting</em>. It's almost perfect that an album telling such personal stories of pain and heartbreak should be released on the national day of \"love\". I may not fully enjoy what this record brings to the table, mostly due to the instrumentation that surrounds the heart shattering lyrics which just don't seem to justify it, but Thorburn is really onto something here with this release. The record was written in the brief aftermath of a failed relationship and his heart is really worn on his sleeve during each track. It's the bittersweet glimpse into a broken-hearted man which we may have heard thousands upon thousands of times before, but Islands somehow does it differently. They put this upbeat, pop nature into each track which almost takes away from the despair of the lyrics a little too much for me. I respect the songwriting a great deal but I find the music a bit disengaging personally. All in all though, this is a very respectable album from an even more respectable indie band. It also has the perfect album cover for the material within.</p>\\n<p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n              <a href=\"#stream\" class=\"player-link stream\" title=\"Stream\">\\n        Stream<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n                    <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link76163-2\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-2');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title76163-2\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-2');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">Islands</span> - Lonely Love <span class='time'>(03:40)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div><p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n          <a href=\"http://files2.earmilk.com/tracks/MjAxMi0wMi8wNiBDYW50IEZlZWwgTXkgRmFjZS5tcDM=.mp3\" class=\"player-link download\" title=\"Download\">\\n        Download<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n                        <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link76163-3\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-3');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title76163-3\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-3');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">Islands</span> - Can't Feel My Face <span class='time'>(02:46)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div><p>read the full earmilk.com album review <em><strong><a href=\"http://www.earmilk.com/2012/02/16/the-islands-a-sleep-a-forgetting-album-review/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></strong></em>!</p>\\n<hr />\\n<h2>Damien Jurado - <em>Maraqopa</em>:</h2>\\n<p><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/AU0Ma.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" />It's quite incredible to think about how consistent <strong>Damien Jurado</strong> has been for the last 15 years. He has released 10 albums, most of which have had this enormous cult following of dedicated fans and critics. His lo-fi, folk music has always been very independent of anything else, at least in the modern era. I, for one, didn't get into Damien Jurado until 2010's <em>Saint Bartlett </em>which seemed to be a much more conservative approach to his songwriting especially in a musical sense. On his new release <em>Maraqopa</em>, Damien seems like he has erupted with confidence. His self-belief oozes out with every single note on guitar and in every single lyric. On the first track of the record entitled \"Nothing Is The News\", Damien explodes with these powerful electric guitars and booming organs that just carry so much potential energy. The strong opener is a sign of things to come as the rest of the album ventures into some 70's psychedelic ideas. A lot of reverb and plenty of distortion really bring this \"not so simple\" folk record to a totally new helm. At times I feel like I'm listening to an ancient <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6ibl6PIKPM\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Young</a></strong> record. On the bright side of the songwriting, I finally got out of the Valentine's Day sadness cycle and into a totally different scheme of the celebration of man kind and the shared human beliefs among our crumbling society. Jurado is at an all new high with his latest record as the career road blocks haven't even seen the light of day for him.</p>\\n\\n<p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n              <a href=\"#stream\" class=\"player-link stream\" title=\"Stream\">\\n        Stream<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n                    <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link76163-4\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-4');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title76163-4\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-4');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">Damien Jurado</span> - So On, Nevada <span class='time'>(02:30)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div><p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n          <a href=\"http://files2.earmilk.com/tracks/MjAxMi0wMi8wMSBOb3RoaW5nIGlzIHRoZSBOZXdzLm1wMw==.mp3\" class=\"player-link download\" title=\"Download\">\\n        Download<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n                        <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link76163-5\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-5');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title76163-5\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-5');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">Damien Jurado</span> - Nothing Is The News <span class='time'>(05:33)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div><hr />\\n<h2>James Murray - <em>Floods</em>:</h2>\\n<p><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/gCBpz.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" />Ambient music has always been a strong favorite of mine among music genres. I love almost everything about it from the soothing nature of the slow progressions musically to the subtle, yet powerful marathons of harmonic sounds. The brilliance within the genre is infinite especially as the genre continues to evolve. Even so, some ambient artist's stick to their roots. <em>Floods</em> serves as <strong>James Murray</strong>'s description of the beauty and also the terrifying power of one of our world's most important, key elements, water. As important as water is to each of us on a daily basis, most of us don't take the time to muse over the elegance and strength it conceals. One day, water can be the most destructive force in the world, killing thousands in a flood but the next it could provide life sustaining nourishment to a village in terrible need. James Murray intended to explore these ideas musically, using some very ethereal and dreamy qualities on tracks such as \"Greenlands\" and also some more powerful, striking qualities on tracks like \"Floods\". Over the course of the record, we are put through both ideas and forced to envision the negative features that water could bring to mankind. Murray isn't trying to scare us however, he's more or less just trying to show us the light in a way I guess. Water isn't something to be frightened of, just something we should never take for granted or underestimate. Sometimes the most important piece of human existence could be exactly what denies that same existence. This album is very tender and fruitful but at the same time it's brilliance lies within it's fearful juxtaposition. I love the themes and ideas that <em>Floods</em> serves. </p>\\n<p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n              <a href=\"#stream\" class=\"player-link stream\" title=\"Stream\">\\n        Stream<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n                    <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link76163-6\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-6');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title76163-6\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-6');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">James Murray</span> - Greenlands <span class='time'>(06:12)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div><p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n          <a href=\"http://files2.earmilk.com/tracks/MjAxMi0wMi9KYW1lcyBNdXJyYXkgLSBGbG9vZHMgLSAwNCBGbG9vZHMubXAz.mp3\" class=\"player-link download\" title=\"Download\">\\n        Download<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n                        <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link76163-7\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-7');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title76163-7\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-7');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">James Murray</span> - Floods <span class='time'>(06:55)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div><hr />\\n<h2>The Maccabees - <em>Given To The Wild</em>:</h2>\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.earmilk.com/wp/2012/02/20/straight-from-the-teet-3/1326131710-300/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-76579\"><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-76579\" title=\"1326131710-300\" src=\"http://www.earmilk.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/1326131710_300-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" /></a>On <strong>The Maccabees</strong>' third effort, the group has found a much more expansive sound. They decided to ditch Markus Dravs, <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZockGkEyY\" target=\"_blank\">Arcade Fire</a></strong> producer, and go with Tim Goldsworthy and Bruno Ellingham who were successful with the likes of <strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7K72X4eo_s&amp;ob=av2e\" target=\"_blank\">Massive Attack</a></strong>. Just by understanding that, you should already get the idea that <em>Given To The Wild</em> will be much more anthemic in nature. This matured, evolved sound bleeds out on most of the tracks off the new LP and it's so invigorating. Just to shake that conformed, alternative sound where people just continued to label them as little brothers to Arcade Fire, The Maccabees have totally revived themselves. Evidence points to the brand new production team for this as you can identify the grandiose arrangements put in place. This is especially evident on tracks such as \"Child\" and \"We Grew Up At Midnight\" as the songs flow out with these great guitar fillers and more electronic elements are put into effect. Orlando Weeks is better then ever with his vocals which pour out of his soul with such elegance and confidence. You can really spot some of the more trip hop influence with the drums too as they carry each beat with such relative ease. The guitars, although they have been asked to have more of a backing roll on a lot of these tracks, do take this album to a whole other level. The patience by guitarists Hugo and Felix White is tremendous as they know their place and just have timing down to near perfection. The pop sound, to me, isn't a step back what so ever. In fact, I think it's the complete opposite. The Maccabees have always been beaten over their heads by critics and they still continue to be which is really surprising to me. This album won't be one of the best records of 2012  but this new LP should definitely be on any indie fan's \"albums to check out\" list. Just make sure to not be suede too much by the negative criticism this band has been poisoned by.</p>\\n<p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n              <a href=\"#stream\" class=\"player-link stream\" title=\"Stream\">\\n        Stream<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n                    <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link76163-8\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-8');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title76163-8\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-8');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">The Maccabees</span> - Child <span class='time'>(04:31)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div><p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n          <a href=\"http://files2.earmilk.com/tracks/MjAxMi0wMi8xMy10aGVfbWFjY2FiZWVzLWdyZXdfdXBfYXRfbWlkbmlnaHQubXAz.mp3\" class=\"player-link download\" title=\"Download\">\\n        Download<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n                        <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link76163-9\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-9');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title76163-9\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-9');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">The Maccabees</span> - Grew Up At Midnight <span class='time'>(04:00)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div><hr />\\n<h2>Ben Kweller - <em>Go Fly A Kite</em>:</h2>\\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.earmilk.com/wp/2012/02/20/straight-from-the-teet-3/ben-kweller-go-fly-a-kite/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-76637\"><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-76637\" title=\"Ben Kweller Go Fly A Kite\" src=\"http://www.earmilk.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Ben-Kweller-Go-Fly-A-Kite-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" /></a>Ben Kweller </strong>has had an interesting career. His music, although not terribly popular, has seen appearance after appearance on movie soundtracks to radio air play. You would think his career might have blossomed but it stayed on a basically even keel. That's not to say his music hasn't blossomed because it kind of has. I remember back in 2006 when I had first heard his self titled, third LP which was pretty generic overall. It carried the pop sounds that got his music established though when songs like \"Sundress\" were suddenly put into romantic comedies as if no other song could have replaced it. A few years later though, Kweller put out my favorite album of his entitled <em>Changing Horses</em>. It was a totally different direction as the influences were solely old, \"mid-western\", country music. The steel slide guitars were so stimulating and with a more folk sounding vocal display, the album just showed a quickly evolving musician. Even so, <em>Go Fly A Kite</em> was not on my \"most anticipated albums of 2012\" list mainly just because his constant changes in direction with his latter albums. Believe it or not, this album was actually delayed for about a year when Kweller parted ways with ATO Records last March. Kweller believed that by leaving his label and releasing the album under his own label, it would allow him to perfect his song crafting and spend more time with each track. He hated the idea of rushing out records so the more time the better. The new record though, is a total lackluster. Kweller is trying to use more electric guitars and a heavier sound in general. Most of the time it just sounds like one of those 1970's classic rock records that we all outgrew when we were 14 years old. The guitar playing is good but it's just the fact that I've heard this two too many times over the course of my life. His vocals have tried to garner more energy with some bluesy type of yelling here and there but even that just sounds so prosaic to me. His album art is very revealing of all this too with the image of an \"E\" chord on guitar. This chord shows up far too often on the album so I'm not sure it was totally necessary to use it as the album cover but to each his own. Although Kweller was trying to expand on his sound, it seems he has put himself into a creative hole with no sign of being able to climb out. </p>\\n<p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n              <a href=\"#stream\" class=\"player-link stream\" title=\"Stream\">\\n        Stream<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n                    <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link76163-10\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-10');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title76163-10\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-10');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">Ben Kweller</span> - Free <span class='time'>(03:40)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div><hr />\\n<h2>Saltillo - <em>Monocyte</em>:</h2>\\n<p><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/EbV23.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" />You know what? I'm not really into bashing musical artists especially ones who I have used to enjoy. I know it's basically part of the business as a music writer but it's just not me normally. I always like to see the bright side of things on albums especially the ones I post here on <a href=\"http://www.earmilk.com/\" target=\"_blank\">earmilk.com</a>. Six years ago, if you are a trip hop fan, you were blessed with a release called <em>Ganglion</em>. The album was by a first time artist named <strong>Saltillo</strong> and his brand of trip hop was very interesting as he was a classically trained violinist. With that as an influence, his songs always combined the minimalism of droning, electronic beats with a wide array of violin sounds that protruded so beautifully. It was a very distinctive sound that really got his name out there among indie and electronic fans alike. So now, six years later, we finally have a second release from Saltillo. The album, <em>Monocyte</em>, is relatively the same type of record as it's predecessor. The violins show up huge and the electronics have become even more droning to the point where the trip hop feel is almost totally gone. Most of the time, this record sounds like an experimental nightmare because of its complexities. I do respect the fact that Saltillo found it necessary to experiment a bit more after his successful debut but I mean, it's six years later. The thrill is taken out by the fact that we had to wait so long for something so manipulated. For the most part, this record just sounds like a remix of <em>Ganglion</em> with more bass and drone sounds. There are a few high points such as \"If Wishes Were Catholics\" where the female vocals bring out a necessary brightness to such dark, almost overwhelming song craft. \"I Hate You\" is another track I quite liked but it's mainly because I was so familiar with the song structure as it sounded just like something off of his last LP. It's all a bit sad for me as this record was one of the albums I was looking forward to most this year but it just didn't come through for me. </p>\\n<p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n              <a href=\"#stream\" class=\"player-link stream\" title=\"Stream\">\\n        Stream<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n                    <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link76163-11\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-11');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title76163-11\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-11');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">Saltillo</span> - If Wishes Were Cathloics <span class='time'>(05:15)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div><p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n          <a href=\"http://files2.earmilk.com/tracks/MjAxMi0wMi8wNy4gU2FsdGlsbG8gLSBJIEhhdGUgWW91Lm1wMw==.mp3\" class=\"player-link download\" title=\"Download\">\\n        Download<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n                        <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link76163-12\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-12');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title76163-12\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76163-12');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">Saltillo</span> - I Hate You <span class='time'>(04:00)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div><hr />\\n<p> Another week of album listens is finito and I am ready for another week as I look forward to getting back to all of you readers next Monday.

We thank France for this wonderful deliverance and you'll quickly understand why. The video below is taken from Pegase's single \"Without Reason\", directed by <a href=\"http://incrediblekids.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Incredible Kids</a>. Rather than your average music video, the visuals reminds us of a hand decorated sci-fi movie. It starts off in the woods with a group of teenagers in obscure costumes and ends with an assembly of them, gazing at a dark cult initiation.

On a reviewers note, my favorite joint on VICtory Session Vol. I is the party jump-off \"I See What You're Doin (And I Like It)\". It's a great mix of 21st century Hip Hop rhymin', 70's funk riffs, 80's synthesizers and 90's high energy R&amp;B vocals. Plus that percussion time signature change at 1:57 was much appreciated.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>\"The VICtory Sessions are a collection of works and collaborations centered around the recent cancer diagnosis to Audible Mainframe front man MC Exposition (Victor Pontes-Macedo).</p>\\n<p>These works encompass everything that we have written and recorded since 2010 until current day. The sessions will be released as short EP's broken up into separate collectable volumes.

But unfortunately I have not been able to unearth such a remix. On the other hand I am very intrigued by this song. With her typical dream pop sound toned done with slower leads and more repetitive rhythms on this track. Not something that is typically flattering in a dream pop sound, yet here it is and causes the lyrics to carry with more resonance and impact. The song leaves waiting for more and looking forward to her full release.  Check the song out below along with another single off her upcoming release.</p>\\n<p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n                  <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/nite-jewel/in-the-dark\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"player-link soundcloud\" title=\"Soundcloud\">\\n        SC<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n            <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/nite-jewel/in-the-dark\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"player-link soundcloud-stream\" title=\"Soundcloud Stream\">\\n      Stream<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n            <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link75654-0\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('75654-0');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title75654-0\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('75654-0');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">In The Dark</span> <span class=\"time\">(04:20)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div>  </p>\\n<p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n                  <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/nite-jewel/one-second-of-love\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"player-link soundcloud\" title=\"Soundcloud\">\\n        SC<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n            <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/nite-jewel/one-second-of-love\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"player-link soundcloud-stream\" title=\"Soundcloud Stream\">\\n      Stream<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n            <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link75654-1\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('75654-1');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title75654-1\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('75654-1');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">One Second Of Love</span> <span class=\"time\">(04:03)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/earmilk/~4/0isvZZWxGsA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>	3	\\N	\\N	2012-02-20 22:49:25	2012-02-21 03:30:04.895342	nite-jewel-in-the-dark	oQLhv.png	2012-02-21 03:30:04.740183\n 1313: 15	Candyland, FTampa - \"Hypnotic\"	\\N	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/earmilk/~3/F5tRad4KM-s/	<img src='http://earmilk.com/c/images/medium/candyland.png' alt=''/><p></p>\\n<p title=\"Solstice Bass\">Santa Barbara dubstep and electro house producers <strong>Candyland</strong> turn it up a notch with this fresh new electro house tune they put together with<strong> FTampa</strong>. 2011 was a big year for Candyland as they hit top 5 dubstep charts with their last EP, <em><a href=\"http://www.earmilk.com/2011/12/31/candyland-prelude-ep-play055/\">Prelude</a></em>, released by <strong>Play Me Records</strong>.

Combining elements of UK bass, tech house, and traditional/deep house, the remix takes Bambounou's more subdued garage original \"Heroic Deeds\" and turns it explosive with more pronounced percussion and a quicker pace. Definitely looking forward to what this duo continues to bring to the dancefloor, keep an eye on them! If you're in Boston, you can catch them at <strong>Middlesex Lounge</strong> with DJ Die Young, El Poser, Glass Teeth and Nebulust on March 5 for CVLT.</p>\\n<p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n                  <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/l-a-d-s/heroic-deeds-ladsremix\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"player-link soundcloud\" title=\"Soundcloud\">\\n        SC<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n                <a href=\"http://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/37180393/download?consumer_key=05c76df9f7dc61bd4981517dc069adee\" class=\"player-link soundcloud-download\" title=\"Soundcloud Download\">\\n      Download<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n        <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link76843-0\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76843-0');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title76843-0\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76843-0');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">Bambounou-Heroic Deeds(LADS REMIX)</span> <span class=\"time\">(05:22)</span></span>\\n  </div>\\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\\n</div></p>\\n<p>You can download the track for free on L.A.D.S.'s Soundcloud.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/l-a-d-s\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>L.A.D.S. on Soundcloud</strong></a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dark-and-Stormy/114652691906543\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dark &amp; Stormy on Facebook</strong></a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Loopus-Amadeus/148665811830503\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Loopus Amadeus on Facebook</strong></a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/bambounou\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Bambounou on Twitter</strong></a></li>\\n</ul><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/earmilk/~4/9cf1Yrc4AKg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>	3	\\N	\\N	2012-02-20 19:11:49	2012-02-21 03:30:39.808134	bambounou-heroic-deeds-l-dot-a-d-dot-s-remix	wolfgirl.png	2012-02-21 03:30:39.701164\n 1316  18	Suicide Sundaes - Week 90	\\N	http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/earmilk/~3/c06_tn0pmvA/	<img src='http://earmilk.com/c/images/medium/suicide-sundaes.png' alt=''/><p></p>\\n<p><strong>Suicide Sundaes</strong> - Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen, Sunday is back with a vengeance. <strong>Greg</strong>  is here to bring you the week's dirty servings, and some old favorites through a throwdown-throwback to simpler times. A time when bangers were big, remixes were bigger, the bassline bled, and we didn't care about anything as long as came in kicking and left screaming.</p>\\n<p>This week we're kickin' things off with a bit of a retro vibe starting with a killer remix done by <strong>Moulinex</strong>, it's a bit of an older track but it's one that I felt went a bit under the radar. One of the next notable tracks that I couldn't resist because of its awesome disco vibe is a new track from <strong>Chris Malinchak</strong> entitled \"Deal 'Em\". I really cannot wait until we start getting remixes of this one.</p>\\n<p>In Scoops, be sure to check out \"Nightfalls\" by <strong>Fatso</strong> and \"Singed\" by <strong>Tyler Clark</strong>, these are a couple of my favorites from this week's post. <strong>Nation</strong>'s new track \"Mankir\" is one of the more <em>epic</em> songs I've heard in a while, I really like the tone of this one. Oh and I'm also bringing you guys a remix of <strong>Skrillex</strong>'s \"True Gangsters\" done by <strong>Distantt</strong> that's been growing on me. Let me know what tracks are your favorite this week in the comments.</p>\\n<p>Enjoy.</p>\\n<h2>Sprinkles</h2>\\n\\n<p><div class=\"player-links\">\\n  <div class=\"track-single page-feed\">\\n          <a href=\"http://files2.earmilk.com/tracks/MjAxMi0wMi9YaW5vYmkgLSBCTVggKE1vdWxpbmV4IFJlbWl4KS5tcDM=.mp3\" class=\"player-link download\" title=\"Download\">\\n        Download<span></span>\\n      </a>\\n                        <a href=\"#play\" class=\"player-link play track\" id=\"link76672-0\" title=\"Play\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76672-0');return false;\">\\n      Play<span></span>\\n    </a>\\n    <span class=\"player-link-title\" id=\"title76672-0\" onclick=\"togglePlayById('76672-0');return false;\"><span class=\"artist\">Xinobi</span> -

They are the new heavy electronic powered group featuring members of The Disco Biscuits. The made the Avicii &#8211; Seek Bromance remix that a simliar heavy electronic meets live electronic band sound that worked very well. This track is a lot more agressive and heavy then the original. This is the official release of the song, there are no plans to sell it, and Porter has given full approval.
